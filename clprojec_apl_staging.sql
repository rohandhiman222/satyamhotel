The effects of VR on dissociative symptoms were not in the clinical range or even within subclinical levels of dissociative experiences. The effects observed in the current study may be similar to spending several hours working at a computer and temporarily feeling more detached from objective reality than usual.

Management strategies have been proposed to reduce distress during dental treatment in children and are mainly divided into two broad categories. The first module\r\nconsists of behavioral techniques including the tell- show-do technique, distraction, inspiration, modeling and hypnotism. The second category consists of pharmacologic techniques.2,3\r\nDistraction appears to be safe and inexpensive and gives rise to an effective relaxed experience in short\r\npainful dental procedure. Previous studies have shown that distraction is the most common technique\r\nused to reduce pain in short invasive medical procedures. The application of distraction is based on the assumption that pain perception has a large psychological component in that the amount of attention directed to the noxious stimuli modulates the perceived pain. Although the precise mechanism of distraction is not yet well understood, cognitive-affective attention models may explain this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nMcCaul and Mallet developed the existing theory by placing emphasis on the fact that the capacity of humans to pay attention is limited. They point out that an individual should concentrate on the painful stimuli in order to perceive pain; therefore, perception of pain decreases when a person’s attention is distracted away from the stimulus. Based on the results of a number of studies the ideal process of distraction requires the capture of the child’s various senses such as vision, hearing and touch and actively engaging the child’s emotions. Therefore the ideal distracter would require an optimal amount of attention involving multiple sensory modalities (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic), active emotional involvement and participation of the patient to compete with the signals from the noxious stimuli.\r\n\r\nPrevious techniques to distract a child include watching television, listening to music, counting the furniture in the room and non-medical dialogs, which serve to distract the child’s attention from\r\nanxiety-provoking stimuli. Comparing three distraction techniques for reducing stress in patients, Seyrek et al.10 found that video techniques were more effective than an audio program. Results further suggested that successful distraction was accompanied by an increase in physiological arousal, possibly indicating the degree of psychological absorption or engagement in the video.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in behavioral research in virtual reality (VR) and virtual world. VR refers to a human–computer interface that enables the user to interact dynamically with the computer-generated environment. In contrast to the less complex audiovisual (A/V) distraction, VR uses sophisticated systems such as head-mounted, wide field-of-view; three-dimensional displays (HMDs) and motion sensing systems that measure the user’s head and hand positions. This application may be superior to traditional distraction because it offers more immersive images due to the occlusive head sets that project the images right in front of the eyes of the user and, depending on the model used, block out real-world (visual, auditory, or both) stimuli. VR even combines the audio, visual, and kinesthetic sensory modalities. Depending on how immersive the presented stimuli are, the person’s attention will be more or less “drained” from the real world, leaving less attention available to real-world processes, including painful stimuli. Immersion is particularly increased during VR because the use of HMDs prevents patients from seeing what is happening in the real world and directs the focus on what is going on in the virtual world. Therefore, the child’s attention is focused on what happen in the virtual world rather than on the surrounding environment.8 Sullivan et al.11 demonstrated that using virtual reality during dental treatment had no significant effect on the behavior or anxiety but significantly reduced the pulse. Literature review reveals sparse investigations regarding the use of VR technique in children. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the effect of\r\n\r\nVR distraction on the pain perception and state anxiety in children considering primary childhood anxiety disorders as an important confounding variable. In the present study, an attempt was made to eliminate the effects of childhood anxiety disorders during the use of VR distraction during routine dental treatment. The objective of this study was to answer the question, as to whether VR distraction is effective in reducing pain and anxiety as adjunct to traditional behavior management strategies in the dental setting and procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterials and Methods\r\n\r\nThis single-blind crossover clinical trial study was carried out in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry\r\nat Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Re- search Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of medical Sciences (Ref: 89.50). The participants consisted of 120 children between 4-6 years of age who attended Department of Pediatric Dentistry of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences for routine dental care from November 2011 until March 2012. Children who did not have anxiety disorders at the first attendance according toSCARED questionnaire were included in the study.\r\n\r\nOther inclusion criteria were the first attendance and presence of at least two carious mandibular primary molars requiring restorative treatment. From the 250 children matching the inclusion criteria, 120 subjects were randomized into two groups. A random allocation list was generated using a randomization software (RandList version 1.2; DatIng GmbH, Tübingen, Deutschland; seed number: 1,901,365,632) to allocate subjects to any of the groups, one by one according to their order of ad- mission.\r\n\r\nThe treatment consisted of three consecutive sessions. All dental procedures were carried out by one pediatric dentist. The VR device (i-glasses 920HR Ilixco, Inc. Menlo Park, CA, USA) used during the dental procedures blocked the visual field of the child completely and had headphones to deliver the sound. The device was connected to a player capable of playing MP4 audio-visual files. A single episode of the cartoon series “Tom and Jerry” was played for all subjects throughout the study.\r\nIn the first session, all the children in both groups received fluoride therapy without any intervention.\r\nIn the second session VR device was introduced to the subjects in group 1 using tell-show-do technique before treatment. Once VR device was adopted on the child’s eyes, playing the cartoon was started. Then, topical anesthetic agent was placed by a piece of cotton roll on the injection site,12 and inferior alveolar block injection was administered, followed by a primary mandibular molar restoration. Subjects in group 2 received similar procedures without the use of VR distraction. In the third appointment which\r\ntook place 1 to 2 weeks after the second session,primary mandibular molar restoration with inferior alveolar nerve block injection was performed with and without VR distraction in groups 2 and 1, respectively. Each therapeutic session lasted about half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe Instruments\r\nScreen for Child Anxiety Related Disorder (SCARED) Questionnaire: The parent version of this questionnaire has been designed to evaluate symptoms as a result of separation anxiety, overall anxiety, phobic disorders, compulsive disorders, fear of trauma, social phobia, specific phobia and fear of school in children under 8 years of age. The questionnaire was used to evaluate the presence of childhood background anxiety disorders in the subjects. In this questionnaire, scores above 25 indicate the\r\npresence of childhood anxiety disorders and were excluded from the study.13 The Persian format of the\r\nquestionnaire had been used in previous studies. Faces version of the Modified Child Dental\r\nAnxiety Scale [MCDAS(f)] Questionnaire: This questionnaire is used for evaluating state anxiety in\r\nwide age range in children during dental procedures. This index is self-reported and consists of 8 questions with 5 pictorial answers for each question. Scores on the MCDAS(f) scale may range from 8 to\r\n40, with scores below 19 indicating absence of state anxiety, scores higher than 19 indicating the presence of state anxiety and scores higher than 31, indicating severe phobic disorder (Figure 1).16 The\r\n\r\nPersian format of this questionnaire had also been used in previous studies.Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale: This technique was used to assess pain perceived during dental procedures. It consists of a number of faces ranging from happy to crying. The children were asked to indicate the level of pain they perceived on this pictorial index (Figure 2).17 Once the treatment is completed, the eyeglasses were removed.11 Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, which is a self-reported scale was explained and shown to the subjects immediately after treatment and they were asked to show the face which\r\nbest depicted the pain level they experienced during treatment. Faces version of the Modified Children\r\nDental Anxiety Scale [MCDAS (f)] was used to Figure 1. Faces version of the Modified Child Dental\r\nAnxiety Scale [MCDAS(f)] Questionnaire evaluate state anxiety of the subjects in a manner similar to the evaluation of pain.\r\n\r\nData Analysis\r\n\r\nData were analyzed using SPSS version 15.0 software (SPSS Inc.). Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact Test was used to assess gender difference between the two groups. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare age and anxiety disorders (SCARED) scores differences between the two groups. Paired samples and independent sample t-tests were used to compare the level of pain and state anxiety. The Kappa statistic was calculated for inter- and intra-rater reliability assessments. The statistical significance was set to 0.05.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThree of the 120 subjects failed to attend the second and third treatment sessions, leaving a total of 117 subjects in the present study. The overall mean age of patients was 5.4 years (range, 4-6). The mean ages of the subjects in groups 1 and 2 were 5.18 ± 0.67 and 5.65 ± 0.71 years, respectively. No significant difference was seen in the means of ages between the two groups (P = 0.81). The subjects comprised 33 boys and 25 girls in group 1 and 30 boys and 29 girls in group 2, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding gender (Fisher’s Exact test, P =0.75). The mean SCARED score was 16.74 ± 1.52 in groups 1 and 16.65 ± 2.03 in group 2 Childhood Anxiety-Related Disorders scores did not differ significantly between the two groups (Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.81).\r\nIn group 1, the mean faces scale pain scores in the first (with VR distraction) and second (without VR distraction) treatment sessions were 1.89 ± 0.65 and 3.00 ± 0.81, respectively. These values represent a statistically significant increase in pain score. In group 2, the mean of faces scale pain score was 3.05\r\n± 0.60 in the first treatment session (without VR distraction), which decreased to 2.05 ± 0.60 in the second session (with VR distraction). In both groups, a statistically significant difference was detected between the two treatment sessions (P < 0.001; Figure 3).\r\nSimilarly, in group 1 the Mean MCDAS (f) anxiety scores in the first (with VR distraction) and second\r\n(without VR distraction) treatment sessions were 12.58 ± 1.01 and 17.68 ± 1.25, respectively. These values represent a statistically significant increase in anxiety score. In group 2, the Mean MCDAS (f) anxiety scores was 18.25 ± 1.02 in the first treatment session (without VR distraction), which decreased to 13.20 ± 1.00 in the second treatment session (with VR distraction). In both groups, a statistically significant difference was detected between the two treatment sessions (P < 0.001; Figure 4).\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nThis study tested the effects of distraction using virtual-reality technology on pain perception and anxiety level in children who were primarily screened in order to childhood anxiety related disorders as an important confounding factor in the dental setting.\r\n\r\nFigure 2. Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale.\r\nFigure 3. The error bars of pain severity as determined by faces scale in the two groups under study.\r\n\r\nGroup 1: VR device used in the second appointment;\r\nGroup 2: VR device used in the third appointment.\r\n\r\nDental anxiety which is an example of state anxiety might be influenced by trait anxiety. Trait anxiety\r\nrefers to a general level of stress that is characteristic of an individual, that is, a trait related to personality; and has a constant level during the life span.18 It has been shown that patients who have a high level of trait anxiety usually report higher levels of anxiety and pain during dental procedures,19,20 and do not respond well to distraction techniques.21 To the best of our knowledge previous studies have not taken into account the influence of the issue and therefore, in our study, SCARED questionnaire was used to exclude the children who had anxiety disorders as a confounding affects of anxious personality on dental anxiety.18 Since individuals have different pain thresholds, the present study was designed as a crossover study so that each individual would be compared with themselves in two different situations and, therefore the differences in pain threshold would not result in bias in reporting the results. Moreover, unpleasant pain experience can increase pain perception and anxiety during the next sessions, resulting, in turn, to perceive more pain.20 It has also been demonstrated\r\n that distraction techniques are less effective in individuals who have a previous bitter pain experience.9\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the present study subjects were excluded if they had previous invasive painful medical or dental history. The results of the present study showed that use of VR distraction was effective in decreasing pain perception and state anxiety level in children without anxiety disorders during routine dental treatment. In same line, review of the literature revealed a decrease in the stress levels in the majority of studies using VR distraction.2,22,23 Several studies have shown that VR distraction has positive effect on pain, anxiety and behavior during medical procedures such as treatment of traumatic injuries, burn care, dental procedures, chemotherapy, injection or blood sampling, and physiotherapy.2,22-29 These benefits may be related to more immersive images due to the occlusive headsets that project the images right in front of the eyes of the user and block out real- world (visual, auditory, or both) stimuli. The child’s attention is focused on what happen in the virtual world rather than on the surrounding environment.VR even combines the audio, visual, and kinesthetic sensory modalities. Therefore VR, being the most immersive of all and depending on how immersive the presented stimuli are, the person’s attention will be more or less “drained” from the real world, leaving less attention available to process other real-world, including painful stimuli.11,24 The application of VR distraction is based on the assumption that pain perception has a large psychological component and that pain attracts a strong attentive response because of the potential threat of damaged tissue associated with the sensation. The redirection (distraction) of this attention manipulates the pain perception, thereby reducing the intensity of pain. Recently it has also been found that VR changes the way people interpret incoming pain signals and actually reduces the amount of pain-related brain activity. Moreover it can be concluded that VR engages the conscious attention of the patient, resulting in less pain perception by the patients.24 By diverting attention from an unpleasant medical setting to a pleasant and absorbing virtual world, while also engaging higher cognitive and emotional centers of the nervous system, VR can markedly diminish a patient’s subjective pain experience. In addition, researchers have evaluated the neurobiological mechanism of VR technique in the brain by fMRI and have concluded that the effect of VR technique on pain perception is beyond simple distraction. 31 VR technique produces a deep illusion of entering a virtual world produced by a computer through coordination of sensory perceptions (vision, hearing and sometimes touch), which is referred to as “presence”. Presence forms a basis for VR technique. In fact, the level of presence in the virtual world reflects the amount of attention that individual directs towards the virtual atmosphere; the more an\r\n\r\nFigure 4. The error bars of state anxiety severity as determined by MCDAS(f) in the two groups under\r\n\r\nstudy. Group 1: VR device used in the second appointment; Group 2: VR device used in the third appointment.\r\n\r\nIndividual is absorbed in the virtual world, the less he/she is expected to perceive pain.32 Moreover using fMRI to monitor brain activity during pain distraction, studies have demonstrated that cortical areas associated with attentional processes and pain modulation are more active during distraction, whereas areas associated with pain perception are less ac-\r\ntive. Additional advantages for the use of virtual reality include ease of use, greater control of the therapy, safe in the majority of patients, no need for instructing the patients and the therapeutic personnel. In addition, frequent application of the technique does not decrease its positive effects.25 Therefore, it can easily be used in children and with some size modifications in adults.19\r\nIn accordance with our result, previous studies have shown the efficacy of VR distraction in children. It has shown that VR technique induced a higher level of presence in children compared to adults.26 Das et al.34 reported that older children considered VR technique as a very simple game and therefore younger children are absorbing too much than older children, and therefore have lower level of distraction. These results place great emphasis on the suitability of the selected VR program for the age and personality traits of the subjects, which allows a child to exercise a higher degree of control over the unpleasant stimulus and to imagine himself or herself in a familiar environment.2\r\n\r\nHowever, some contradictory results have also emerged as a result of methodological shortcomings and the use of inappropriate devices. Dahlquist et al21 showed that use of VR technique is more effective in older children than in younger children compared to simple distraction techniques. Since the device used had been designed for adults, the head-phones did not fit very well on young children and therefore did not block the sound and visual field of the surrounding environment in young children. In the present study, smaller size of the VR device was used to accommodate in children. In addition, these devices frequently have been designed for standing or sitting positions, while the device used in the present study is applicable in supine position for dental procedures.\r\nThere are considerations that should be taken into account in virtual reality applications. Hoffman et\r\nal35 reported that a number of patients undergo emotional and nervous states during the first minutes of VR device use and need more time to adapt themselves to the device. In addition, more attention should be paid to differences of personality traits which lead to emotional states in the individual.\r\nFanurik et al8 divided their child subjects into attender and distractor groups. The attender group consisted of children who focused all their attention on the therapeutic process; therefore, lack of the visual field during VR device use meant lack of control for them, which increased their anxiety level. In contrast, distracters were children who focused their attention on processes of the therapeutic procedure; therefore, they experienced less anxiety.24\r\n\r\nIn summary, the findings of the present study confirm the efficacy of VR distraction in the dental setting. The anxiety-inducing appearance of dental equipment and the child’s focusing on all the details of the procedure is one of the most important reasons for stress associated with dental procedures in children. Therefore, the positive effects of VR distraction on the pain and anxiety in children in the present study are attributed to the complete blockage of children’s visual fields, and as a result to a successful distraction technique. Moreover, these benefits may be related to more immersive images due to combination of the audio, visual, and kinesthetic sensory modalities in VR. A limitation of the present study was the fact that the therapeutic procedures were carried out in two separate sessions. It is important to note that the baseline anxiety level of children might be different in each session due to factors such as lack of sleep.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the use of a questionnaire before the procedure in each session to determine the baseline anxiety level in children might assist in eliminating a confounding factor. In addition, since the success of VR technique in distracting the child depends on the appeal of the program played, it is suggested that the patients themselves assist in choosing their favorite programs in order to achieve better results. Another limitation of the present study was the limited age range of the subjects. Children aged 4-6 years of age were included because it has been reported that children at this age range exhibit the most negative and aberrant behaviors during dental procedures and are the most difficult to control.2\r\n\r\nHowever, since different age groups exhibit different cognitive characteristics and behavioral patterns toward VR technique, it is recommended that different age groups be evaluated in future studies. However, considering the fact that children’s anxiety and pain can have different faces with various levels of alarm such as evolving temperament may conspire to affect, positively or negatively, the extrapolation of the results of the present study to a broader sense and\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Reality Distraction in Pediatric Dentistry 123 generalization of the findings necessitates further investigation. It is also suggested that the efficacy of VR technique be evaluated in other dental procedures such as extraction and pulp therapy.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nThis study was supported and funded by Tabriz University of Medical sciences.

Dental practitioners have numerous methods to control anxiety and pain in children, and distracting the child appears to be the most common technique used for behavior management during dental procedures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of using virtual reality eyeglasses on severity of pain and anxiety during dental procedures in pediatric patients.\r\n \r\nMaterials and methods. This study included 120 healthy children aged 4-6 years. Children with no previous anxiety disorder were randomly divided into two groups, each consisting of 60 children. The study consisted of 3 consecutive treatment sessions. During the first visit fluoride therapy was carried out in both groups. In the next sessions, the groups received restorative treatment with and without virtual reality eyeglasses in a randomized single-blind-controlled crossover fashion. Then at the end of each session the subjects’ pain severity was assessed using Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating\r\nScale and state anxiety was measured by Faces version of the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale [MCDAS (f)].\r\n \r\nResults. There was a significant decrease in pain perception (P < 0.001) and state anxiety scores (P < 0.001) with the use of virtual reality eyeglasses during dental treatment.\r\n \r\nConclusion. Results of this study showed that virtual reality eyeglasses can successfully decrease pain perception and state anxiety during dental treatment.

VALMAGGIA, DANIEL FREEMAN, CATHERINE GREEN,\r\nPHILIPPA GARET Y, DAVID SWAPP, ANGUS ANTLEY, CORINNE PRESCOTT, DAVID F OWLER, ELIZABETH KUIPERS, PAUL BEBBINGTON, MEL SLATER, MATTHE W BROOME and PHILIP K. McGUIRE\r\n\r\nBackground Virtual reality provides a means of studying paranoid thinking in controlled laboratory conditions.\r\nHowever, this method has not been used with a clinical group.\r\n\r\nAims To establish the feasibility and safety of using virtual reality methodology in people with an at-risk mental state and to investigate the applicability of a cognitive model of paranoia to this group.\r\n\r\nMethod Twenty-one participants with an at-risk mental state were assessed before and after entering a virtual reality environment depicting the inside of an underground train.\r\n\r\nResults Virtual reality did not raise levels of distress at the time of testing or cause adverse experiences over the subsequent week.Individuals attributed mental states to virtual reality characters including hostile intent. Persecutory ideation in virtual reality was predicted by higher levels of trait paranoia, anxiety, stress, immersion in virtual reality, perseveration and interpersonal sensitivity.\r\n\r\nConclusions Virtual reality is an acceptable experimental technique for use with individuals with at-risk mental states. Paranoia in virtual reality was understandable in terms of the cognitive model of persecutory delusions.\r\nDeclaration of interest None.\r\n\r\nRecent research has shown that it is feasible to use virtual reality (VR) to study persecutory ideation under controlled experimental conditions (Freeman et al, 2003, 2005). In these studies psychological variables identi- fied from a cognitive model of persecutory delusions (Garety et al,  2001; Freeman et  al, 2002) have been used to predict the occurrence  of  persecutory  thoughts about\r\ncomputer characters in a neutral virtual reality social environment. The advantage of this controlled experimental approach  is that stimuli can be controlled and any persecutory ideation that occurs is known to be unfounded and hostility cannot be provoked by the participant. In the future, such virtual environments  may  be  used not only to learn about the causes of para- noia but as an element of treatment, as has occurred for anxiety disorders (Krijn et al,\r\n2004). The present study was designed to test whether this innovative experimental technique  is  safe to  use with individuals  at\r\nrisk of psychosis, and could be used to in-\r\nvestigate cognitive models of psychosis in this group. We expected that virtual reality would be safe and acceptable in this group, and   predicted  that   neutral  behaviour  by computer-generated characters in a  typical social setting would be able to induce persecutory thoughts in participants  with  an at-risk mental state. We then tested the hypothesis that the development of persecutory thoughts in these conditions would be associated with factors implicated in cognitive models of persecutory delusions (Garety et al, 2001; Freeman et al, 2002). As far as is known this is the first test of the virtual reality procedure with a clinical group.\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\nThe design closely followed that developed in previous studies with non-clinical participants (Freeman et al, 2003, 2005). Participants completed a number of assessments before entering a virtual environment. Immediately after leaving this environment, post-virtual reality assessments were administered. In addition, there was a further follow-up assessment after 1 week to deter- mine whether there had been any adverse reactions to the procedure.\r\nThere were 21 participants recruited via Outreach and Support in South London (OASIS), a  specialised  service  for  people at high risk of psychosis (Broome et al, 2005b). All participants were aged between 16 and 35 years, had never experienced a psychotic episode, and were being managed clinically by OASIS in the community. Briefly, participants met one or more  of the following criteria, assessed with a detailed clinical assessment using the Comprehensive Assessment of the At-Risk Mental State (CAARMS; Phillips et al, 2000): (a) attenuated positive psychotic symptoms; (b) brief limited intermittent psychosis (BLIP); or (c) a recent decline in functioning, together with either  schizo- typal personality disorder or a first-degree relative with a psychotic disorder.\r\n\r\nVirtual reality environment\r\n\r\nThe virtual environment was a tube train ride developed by a team at University College London. The environment was modelled on the interior of a London Underground train carriage, and was dis- played in colour (see data supplement in the online version of this paper).\r\nAll seats in the train carriage were taken by 20 computer-generated characters, known as ‘avatars’ – these were male and female, and several different ethnicities were represented. At the first stop, one avatar disembarked and another boarded. Importantly, the avatars were programmed to exhibit only neutral behaviour; they could glance up and around the carriage and they changed facial ex<x>pressions occasionally (for example, smiling), but  they  did not display any overtly hostile or overly friendly behaviour. The background noises and sounds associated with being in a London Underground train  were  played (e.g. when the carriage doors closed participants would hear ‘Mind the closing doors’, while at other times there was the background rumble of a  moving  train).  The environment was designed so that a majority of the general population would find it a neutral experience.\r\nThe virtual environment was displayed in an immersive projection system commonly referred to as a ‘CAVE’ (Fakespace Systems, Iowa) (Cruz-Neira et al, 1993), with four projection walls  (3  walls and the floor). The specific system was a ReaCTor (Trimension, West Sussex). Participants had their head position and\r\norientation tracked with an inertial/ ultrasonic system (IS900 VET tracking system; Intersense, Massachusetts). They also carried a tracked (Intersense) joystick in their right hand. They wore lightweight CrystalEye LCD shutterglasses (Stereo- Graphics, California), which delivered a stereo view of the virtual world, which  surrounded them on four sides. Participants could move through the virtual environment with a combination of walking and whole  body  turning,  and  also by pressing\r\na   button   on   the  joystick,   which moved them forwards in the virtual space in the direction in which they were pointing.\r\n\r\nAssessment instruments\r\n\r\nPre-virtual reality measures The Green et al Paranoid Thoughts Scales (G–PTS; further details available  from C.G.) is a newly developed instrument to measure current ideas of reference and current ideas of persecution based upon a precise definition of persecutory ideation (Freeman & Garety, 2004). The two sub- scales are both 16-item self-report measures\r\nscored from 1 to 5 (1¼not at all, 5¼totally). The scales have displayed good reliability and validity in a large non-clinical sample and in a clinical sample of 50 individuals with persecutory delusions.\r\nThe Paranoia Scale (PS; Fenigstein & Vanable, 1992) is a 20-item self-report scale to assess paranoia in the general population, and includes items assessing both ideas of persecution and reference. Each item is rated on a five-point scale (1–5). Total scores can range from 20 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater paranoid ideation. The PS has demonstrated good re- liability and validity in a large non-clinical sample. This measure was included as an\r\nadditional reliability check for the newer G–PTS, and to enable comparison of the levels of paranoia in the group with other studies. The Interpersonal Sensitivity Scale (IPSM; Boyce & Parker, 1989) is a 36-item scale designed to assess interpersonal sensitivity. Self-statements are rated on a four- point scale (1¼very unlike self, 4¼very like self). The scale generates a total score ranging from 36 to 144 as well as five sub-scales: ‘interpersonal awareness’ (7 items, range 1–28); ‘need for approval’ (8 items, range 8–32); ‘separation anxiety’ (8 items, range 8–32); ‘timidity’ (8 items, range 8–32) and ‘fragile inner self’ (5 items, range 5–20). Higher scores indicate greater interpersonal sensitivity. The IPSM  has good psychometric properties.\r\nThe Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) is a 42-item instrument with three sub-scales measuring current negative emotional states of stress, anxiety and depression. Each of the sub-scales consists of  14  items  with  a  0–3  scale  (0¼did not apply at all to me, 3¼applied to me very much). Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they have experienced each state over the past week. The psychometric qualities of this scale have recently been\r\nestablished in a large UK non-clinical population (Crawford & Henry, 2003).\r\nThe Launay–Slade Hallucinations Scale  (LSHS;  Launay  &  Slade,   1981)  is a 12-item self-report scale to measure hallucinatory predisposition by assessing clinical and sub-clinical hallucinatory phenomena. Participants answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to each item. Higher scores indicate a  greater  predisposition  to  hallucinatory experiences.\r\nThe ‘Beads Task’ (Garety et al, 1991) assesses data gathering style. Individuals are presented with a pair of containers holding beads of  two  different  colours  in a given ratio (in this study 60:40). The ratio of colours is reversed in each jar. With the containers hidden from view, a bead is drawn from one container, shown to the participant and then replaced. The task  is  to work out which container has been chosen. Individuals with delusions typically require significantly fewer items than con- trols before making a decision, indicating the presence of a data gathering or ‘jumping-to-conclusions’ bias (van Dael  et al, 2006).\r\nThe Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST; Heaton et al, 1993) is the most widely used test for executive functioning in schizophrenia research (van Beilen, 2004). Scores are calculated for the number and percentage of errors, correct responses, perseverative and non-perseverative responses, and perseverative and non- perseverative errors. In the current study perseverative errors (higher scores reflect- ing greater mental inflexibility) was the variable of interest.\r\nThe National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson, 1982) aims to give an accurate measure of (pre-morbid) IQ by assessing the ability to read non-phonetic words.\r\n\r\nPost-virtual reality measures\r\n\r\nPre- and Post Virtual Reality Visual Analogue Scales In order to assess whether the procedure caused distress in participants, state anxiety was assessed before and after entering the virtual environment by asking individuals to mark a standard 10 cm visual analogue scale from 0 (not at all anxious) to 10 (extremely anxious). Similarly, participants were asked to rate on a 10 cm visual analogue scale how  unpleasant  (score  0) or pleasant (score 10) their experience  in the tube had been.\r\n\r\nThe Virtual Reality Questionnaire (Freeman et al, 2005)\r\n\r\nThis is a 20-item self-report questionnaire used to assess thoughts about the virtual reality avatars. Each item is scored on a 1–5 scale (1¼do not agree, 5¼totally agree). The scale has 3 sub-scales: virtuality reality–persecution (e.g. ‘Someone had it in for me’, ‘Someone stared at me in order to upset me’, ‘Someone was trying to isolate me’, ‘Someone was trying to make me distressed’); virtual reality–neutral (e.g. ‘No-one had any particular feelings about me’) and virtual reality–positive (e.g. ‘I felt very safe in their company’). The higher the score on a sub-scale the more items were endorsed.\r\n\r\nThe Post Virtual Reality Semi-Structured Interview (Freeman et al, 2003)\r\n\r\nThis is a 10-min semi-structured interview conducted to assess the spontaneous impressions participants made of the environment and the virtual characters. The interviews were tape recorded and then rated (masked to responses on the question- naires) for persecutory content on a 6-point scale (0¼none to 5¼marked). This score from interview was used as a validity check for the self-report virtual reality-persecution scale.\r\nPresence is the extent to which participants in a virtual reality respond to virtual objects and events as if they are real. One of the methods of assessing presence is by the use of a self-rating questionnaire. In this study we used a Presence Questionnaire (Slater et al, 1998) that consists of 6 items, each rated on a scale of 1 to 7 with higher scores indicating greater sense of presence. In the present study, a high sense of presence was defined as a score 6  or  7. No normative reliability or  validity  data  are currently available on this measure, however it has been used in many experimental studies with consistent results (e.g. Slater & Steed, 2000).\r\n\r\nFollow-up assessment\r\n\r\nTo investigate whether the virtual reality experience had triggered any persisting adverse reactions, all participants were contacted by telephone 1 week after the experiment. Participants were asked whether they had thought about the experiment, whether they had had any intrusions regarding the virtual reality environment, and whether their mood and behaviour had been affected in any way by the experiment.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\n\r\nThe study had received approval from the local NHS research ethics committee. Oral and written information about the study was given to the patients and written in- formed consent obtained. Participants were asked to complete the measures described above before entering the virtual environment. There was then a training task to help  participants  familiarise  themselves with virtual reality. Once a  participant was comfortable with the equipment, the experimental environment was presented. Within the virtual reality training module, a  ‘door’  was  opened  revealing  a  passage to the underground train. Participants were instructed to enter the carriage and to stay on board for two stops. They were asked to form an impression of their environment and the people in the carriage – in particular, what they felt towards  the  people  on the tube and what they thought the people on the tube felt  towards  them.  The ‘journey’  lasted  for  4 min,  and  took  them on  the  London  Underground  Central Line from ‘St Paul’s’, stopping at ‘Chancery Lane’, through to ‘Holborn’ where the participant was to disembark. While on the train, the participant was free to move up and down the carriage. Station stops were announced via a recording played through the audio system. After the virtual tube ride, participants were asked to  complete a post-virtual reality visual analogue anxiety    measure,    the    Virtual    Reality Questionnaire, the Presence Questionnaire, and a brief semi-structured interview with the researcher. Participants received a small payment to reimburse their time.\r\n\r\nStatistical analysis\r\n\r\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows (Version 13). All significance test results are quoted as two-tailed probabilities. Associations between the pre-virtual reality measures and persecutory ideation in virtual reality were examined  by Pearson’s correlations. With 21 participants, the study had 80% power to detect a correlation coefficient of 0.54 at a significance level of 0.05 using a two-tailed test (i.e. the study had power only to detect large effect sizes). The study was designed to test the applicability of  the  procedures to a group with at-risk mental state and predict the occurrence of paranoia within this patient group, meaning that a control group was unnecessary.\r\n\r\n RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are displayed in Tables 1 and 2. Most of the participants were young men in full-time employment or students. A substantial proportion (43%) were from minority ethnic groups.\r\nAll participants were experiencing attenuated positive symptoms, although a quarter of the participants (n¼5) also had a history of a BLIP (a very brief period of frank psychosis) and a minority (n¼2) had a family history of mental health problems. The Global Assessment of Functioning Scale mean score was 56.7 (s.d.¼13.5). The sample had an average IQ, as indexed by the NART. Scores on the G–PTS were highly correlated with scores on the PS (R¼0.91, P50.001).\r\n\r\nExperience of the virtual reality environment\r\nOn average 29% of the participants en- dorsed a score 6 or 7 on the Presence Questionnaire (i.e. had the greatest sense of immersion in the experience). The degree of immersion in the virtual reality environment can be illustrated by considering one of the items of the Presence Questionnaire, ‘the sense of actually being in the tube train versus being in the laboratory’. Participants were asked to rate how much they agreed with this statement on a visual analogue scale ranging from 1 (laboratory) to 7 (tube train); 12 participants (57%) felt they  were in a tube train during the experiment (i.e. scored 5, 6 or 7), two people (10%) scored 4 on this item, while 7 participants (33%) had a sense of being in a laboratory (i.e. scored 3, 2 or 1). The virtual reality experience was rated as pleasant (45%) or neutral (25%) by the majority of participants, while a minority rated it as unpleasant (30%). Anxiety  did not increase from before virtual reality (mean anxiety score¼3.2, s.d.¼2.4) to after it (mean anxiety score¼3.7, s.d.¼3.3), Z¼71.065,   P¼0.287.   At   the   one-week follow-up, 16 participants (76%) reported having thought about the virtual reality experience (e.g. ‘I spoke to my friend about it’ or ‘I thought about it a couple of times, be- cause it was real and unreal at the same time. I quite liked it’), but none of the participants reported having had unsolicited or intrusive thoughts or images. No participant reported negative emotions associated with the experience at follow-up and no one had modified their behaviour or avoided going anywhere because of the experiment.\r\n\r\nPersecutory ideation in the virtual reality environment\r\nThe majority of participants (57%) en- dorsed at least one paranoid item in relation to the avatars on the virtual reality– persecution sub-scale. The most endorsed item was ‘Someone was trying to make  me distressed’; 10% ‘agreed a little’ with this statement, 10% ‘agreed moderately’ and 24% ‘agreed very much’ with it. The least endorsed item was ‘Someone  had  it in for me’; 15% of the participants ‘agreed a little’ and 5% ‘agreed moderately’ with this statement. Almost all participants (95%) endorsed at least one neutral item about the virtual reality environment, and 86% agreed with at least one positive statement. Overall, although most of the participants	reported	some paranoid experiences, the environment was mainly experienced as neutral or positive. The masked ratings of persecutory ideation from the recorded post-virtual reality semi-structured interview significantly correlated   with   virtual   reality–persecution scores (R¼0.60, P¼0.005). The interview of one participant could not be  recorded and scored due to a technical problem with the tape recorder. When interviewed, 13 participants (65%) reported neutral or positive impressions about the virtual reality experience (e.g. ‘They did not have any ex<x>pression, I did not think anything about them’, ‘One girl kept smiling at me, she may have fancied me’). The remaining\r\n7  participants  (35%)  reported  slight  to moderate  paranoid  interpretations  (e.g. ‘I\r\nthought one girl was staring at me. She made me angry. I wanted to hit her, so I moved away’, ‘I felt that some people were against me because of their body-language and the whispering and the laughing. I thought that some of them wanted to harm me and that they had an attitude. I felt very angry  towards   them,   and   if somebody would have said anything to me I would\r\nhave wanted to harm them.’).\r\nCorrelations of the measures with the sub-scales of the Virtual Reality Questionnaire are shown in Table 3. The key sub-scale for this study is virtual reality– persecution. It had 10 significant correlations and 8 non-significant  correlations with the other measures. Persecutory ideation in virtual reality was predicted by higher levels of  trait  paranoia,  anxiety, stress, ideas of a fragile inner self, immersion in virtual reality, and perseveration. On the beads task four participants (19%) ‘jumped to conclusions’ (i.e. decided after three beads or fewer) and all but one produced the correct  answer.  However,  the number of draws needed to come to a decision on the beads task was not associated with the occurrence of paranoid thinking    in    virtual    reality    (R¼70.02, P¼0.950).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nOur first concern when using this novel experimental technology with a clinical group at high risk of psychosis was to ensure its safety. The study has demonstrated the safety of the procedures: there were no ad- verse reactions, levels of anxiety were not raised, and the experiment did not create intrusive thoughts. Indicating the clinical and research promise of this approach, many of the individuals with at-risk mental state   did   experience unfounded  paranoid\r\nthoughts  about the virtual reality  characters. These individuals were more likely to experience paranoid thoughts in day-to- day life, validating the methodology. A method of capturing paranoid thoughts in the laboratory for this clinical group has therefore been shown. There is also there- fore the longer-term potential for the procedures to be adapted for aiding psycho- logical interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the causes of paranoid thoughts\r\n\r\nOur second hypothesis was that persecutory ideas induced by the virtual reality procedure would be associated with a number of baseline factors thought to play a key role in the development of psychosis. Cognitive  models  of  delusions postulate that paranoid thoughts are appraisals of experiences (e.g. Bentall et al, 1994; Garety et al, 2001; Freeman et al, 2002, 2006; Broome et al, 2005a). The appraisals are hypothesised to be influenced by emotional processes and reasoning biases. Uniquely, virtual reality enables researchers to investigate the determinants of such appraisals (such as emotion or reasoning) by control- ling the event, so that everyone is exposed to a similar experience. As predicted  by  the cognitive model of persecutory delusions, anxiety, stress and interpersonal sensitivities were associated with higher levels of paranoid ideation in the virtual reality tube environment. There were also trends for depression to be associated with the presence of paranoid thoughts in virtual reality. Intriguingly, the results exactly match those of the previous virtual reality studies with non-clinical populations (Freeman et al, 2003, 2005), which found the same as- sociations between paranoid ideations and other variables. This is supportive of a continuum view of psychotic experiences. The current study also examined executive functioning in relation to paranoid thinking. A perseverative thinking style was positively correlated with persecutory ideation. This suggests that a rigid thinking style might be associated with persecutory appraisals. Perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test are often interpreted as reflecting cognitive  inflexibility,  and  they  are  a    consistent    finding    in    patients  with schizophrenia compared with non-clinical controls (van Beilen, 2004). Intriguingly, our results in participants with an at-risk mental state exactly match those of the previous virtual reality studies in non- clinical populations (Freeman et al, 2003, 2005), which found the same associations between paranoid ideations and these variables. This suggests that similar mechanisms may underlie anomalous experiences in clinical and non-clinical samples and is supportive of a continuum view of psychotic experiences.\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nA key limitation of the current work is the small sample size. This means that the generalisability of the results to other at-risk mental state groups may  be  limited. Further, there was limited ability to detect associations with the pre-virtual reality assessments. Examining interactions be- tween  predictors  was  also  precluded  by the sample size. The scope of the study would have been widened  by  the  inclusion of a matched non-clinical group. The question could then have been addressed of whether individuals at risk of psychosis have greater levels of paranoia in virtual reality compared with non-clinical individuals. It could also be argued that the use of virtual reality technology might be off- putting for potential participants in re- search, and that only a highly selected group take part. Our anecdotal evidence from this study is that at-risk mental state individuals who did not wish to take part did so for reasons unrelated to the technology (e.g. being in full-time employment, not being interested in any kind of research, being away on holiday).\r\n\r\nClinical implications\r\n\r\nVirtual reality is a safe and feasible technique that can be used to investigate the factors associated with paranoid ideations not only in the general population but also in a clinical sample. By creating a con- trolled situation, environmental factors associated with paranoia could be investigated. Furthermore,  virtual  reality  could  be integrated into cognitive–behavioural interventions for psychosis (e.g. Valmaggia et al, 2005). Integrated into cognitive– behavioural therapy, virtual reality could help patients with delusions test out their beliefs and try alternative coping strategies (Greenwood et al, 2006).\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by a programme grant from the Wellcome Trust (No. 062452).

Thirty-four participants diagnosed with eating disorders were evaluated and treated. The clinical improvement was analyzed from statistical and clinical points of view. Results showed that the patients who received the component for body image treatment improved more than the group without this component.

The sense of being\r\nimmersed in another setting is particularly\r\nvaluable in exposure therapy, a treatment\r\ntechnique for phobias. Exposure therapy\r\ninvolves subjecting the patient to anxietyproducing\r\nstimuli while allowing the anxiety\r\nto attenuate. These stimuli have\r\ntraditionally been generated by presenting\r\nthe patient with actual physical situations\r\n(in vivo exposure) or by having the patient\r\nimagine the stimulus.\r\nVR allows a third option of exposure in a virtual\r\nsetting that is safer, less embarrassing, and less costly\r\nthen reproducing the real-world situations and more\r\nrealistic than imagining the danger. An additional\r\nadvantage of computer-controlled stimuli is that the\r\npatient can more easily regulate the level of the\r\ninduced anxiety by modifying the parameters of the\r\nworld to reduce or increase fear to match individual\r\ntolerance. All phobia treatment studies to date have\r\nused a headset to reproduce the feeling of presence in\r\nan anxiety-producing situation.\r\nFear of Heights\r\nThe first phobia studies conducted during late 1993\r\nwere for acrophobia—the fear of heights. This phobia\r\nis characterized by a marked anxiety upon exposure to heights, avoidance of heights, and interference\r\nin normal everyday activities as a result of the\r\nfear. In exposure therapy situations the pattern is for\r\npatients’ anxiety to increase as they are exposed to\r\nmore threatening situations, then for anxiety to\r\ndecrease as they spend more time in each situation.\r\nInitial research was a collaborative effort by computer\r\nscientists and therapists from three Atlanta universities:\r\nGeorgia Tech, Clark Atlanta, and Emory [2].\r\nOut of 478 students initially screened for acrophobia,\r\n20 entered the study; 17 completed it. Subjects were\r\nrandomly assigned to either a treatment group or a\r\nwait-list control group. The treatment group had one\r\npre-treatment VR equipment session and seven\r\nweekly 35- to 45-minute sessions during which they\r\nwere exposed to three virtual height situations—-a\r\nvirtual elevator, a series of virtual bridges, and a series\r\nof virtual balconies. Anxiety, avoidance, distress, and\r\nnegative attitudes towards height decreased significantly\r\nfor the treatment group but not for the waitlist\r\ngroup. By all measures, significant improvement\r\nin the phobia response was found among the subjects\r\nwho completed the VR treatment. Seven of the 10\r\ntreatment completes exposed themselves to height\r\nsituations in real life during the treatment period\r\nalthough they were not specifically instructed\r\nto do so.\r\nIt is interesting to note these results were obtained\r\ndespite primitive computer worlds and poor headset image quality. The tests at times involved teleporting\r\nthe patient from one location to another. Although\r\npatients were aware of the artificial nature of the\r\nscenes, they still felt enough sense of presence to\r\nexhibit the phobic responses while in the headset.\r\nPhysical symptoms\r\nincluded sweaty\r\npalms, loss of balance,\r\nand weakness\r\nin the knees.\r\nPatients indicated\r\nthat a sense of reality\r\nin the virtual\r\nsetting was aided by\r\nhaptic props. For\r\nexample, when riding\r\na glass elevator,\r\na metal bar matching\r\nthe bar location\r\nin the virtual headset\r\nwas provided for\r\nthe subject to hold\r\nin the real world. In\r\nthe spider phobia\r\ndiscussed later, this\r\nsame type of prop\r\nmatches the “feel”\r\nof the virtual to the\r\nreal world.\r\nMax and Sarah\r\nNorth and Joseph\r\nCoble from Clark\r\nAtlanta’s Virtual\r\nTechnology Laboratory,\r\nhave done a\r\nfollow up, in-depth\r\ncase study [6]. A\r\nsubject was asked to\r\nrank a list of acrophobic\r\nsituations\r\naccording to the\r\ndegree of anxiety\r\narousal. The subject\r\nwas placed near a virtual bridge that crossed a river in\r\nthe middle of a simulated town. The study consisted\r\nof one pre-test exposure and eight 15- to 28-minute\r\nsessions. The subject started at the least threatening\r\nsituation and then progressed, under his own control,\r\nto the next level of arousal. An anxiety measurement\r\nwas taken every two to five minutes. At one month\r\npost-treatment, the subject was asked to complete an\r\n11-point rating scale to measure the degree of phobic\r\nresponse change. The patient experienced significant\r\nhabituation of anxiety symptoms and exercised less\r\navoidance of phobic situations after the VR treatment.\r\nLarry Hodges from Georgia Tech’s Graphics,\r\nVisualization and Usability Center and Barbara\r\nR o t h b a u m\r\nfrom Emory led\r\nanother followup\r\ncase study\r\nusing what they\r\nterm VR Exposure\r\n(VRE)\r\ntherapy to treat\r\na 19-year-old\r\nundergraduate\r\nstudent with a\r\nfear of heights\r\nand in particular\r\na fear of\r\nglass elevators.\r\nTwice-weekly\r\nexposure therapy\r\nsessions\r\nwere conducted\r\nfor three weeks\r\non a VR glassenclosed\r\nelevator\r\n(Figure 2).\r\nTime in each\r\nexposure was\r\napproximately\r\n35 minutes.\r\nOutcome was\r\nassessed on\r\nmeasures of\r\nanxiety, avoidance,\r\nattitude,\r\ndistress, and a\r\nbehavioral avoidance\r\ntest. VR\r\ngraded exposure\r\nwas successful in\r\nreducing fear of\r\nheights on all measures.\r\nAt about the same time researchers in Atlanta were\r\nconducting their acrophobia studies, Ralph Lamson,\r\na physician at Kaiser Permanente, was doing similar\r\nwork in California in collaboration with the VR company\r\nDivision Inc. [3]. Acrophobia patients were\r\nrecruited through newspaper ads. Each subject was\r\nexposed to one, 50-minute session where he or she\r\ncompleted a chosen task such as crossing the Golden\r\nGate Bridge or riding in a glass-enclosed elevator.\r\nAccording to Lamson, all 40 of the subjects were able\r\nto complete the task of riding up and down a glass\r\nelevator while looking outside after a single VR\r\ntreatment.\r\nOne result of the numerous fear-of-heights studies\r\nwas to generate an interest in trying this technology\r\nwith a variety of other phobias.\r\nFear of Flying\r\nBoth Georgia Tech and Clark Atlanta followed up\r\nthe acrophobia research with independent fear-offlying\r\nstudies. Georgia Tech conducted a case study\r\nusing a virtual airplane which duplicated a passenger\r\nseated by the window in a standard commercial jet\r\n[7]. The passenger could look out the window and\r\nsee the ground and changing sky scenes (Figure 2).\r\nThe patient was a 42-year-old female with a debilitating\r\nfear and avoidance of flying. As an outpatient\r\nfor seven sessions, she was taught traditional anxiety\r\nmanagement techniques. At that point it was mutually\r\ndecided between the doctor and the patient that\r\nexposure therapy would be beneficial. VR sessions\r\nwere held twice weekly with each session lasting\r\napproximately 35 to 45 minutes. A total of six sessions\r\nwere conducted. During each virtual exposure,\r\nthe subject was allowed to progress at her own pace\r\nalong a natural progression of scenarios—sitting on\r\nthe plane with engines off, sitting on a plane with\r\nengines on, taxiing the runway, smooth takeoff,\r\nsmooth flight, close pass over the airport, landing,\r\nrough takeoff, turbulent flight, and rough landing.\r\nTwo days following the last exposure therapy session\r\nthe subject completed a planned, cross-country\r\nflight with her family. Although the contribution of\r\nthe VR treatment to her improvement is not possible\r\nto determine given the prior inclusion of the anxiety\r\nmanagement techniques, the computer-generated\r\nsimulations were considered significant for several\r\nreasons. First, the patient’s reported anxiety on all\r\nmeasures decreased following exposure to the virtual\r\nplane. Second, she was able to complete a long flight,'),

A key\r\n\r\nquestion, however, is what is the level of realism required in vir-\r\ntual environments to ensure the environment is effective in helping\r\n\r\nthe participant to deal with their anxiety. One concern which af-\r\nfects a lot of people from all walks of life is the fear of a job inter-\r\nview. In this paper we investigate the relationship between anxiety\r\n\r\nand varying levels of realistic fidelity. We recruited 60 volunteers\r\nand studied their anxiety levels via randomised block design, where\r\n\r\neach block was exposed to a different level of fidelity of the vir-\r\ntual avatars: realistic 3D human avatar, cartoon-like 3D avatar, and\r\n\r\nhuman photographs. We measured the social anxiety of all partici-\r\npants via a measure of eyes avoidance behaviour. Our main findings\r\n\r\nare that the participants exhibited more anxiety in accordance with\r\nthe attitude of virtual avatars than the avatar’s level of realism.\r\nCR Categories: I.3.7 [Three-Dimensional Graphics and Realism\r\n]: Virtual Reality and Perception—;\r\nKeywords: Visual Perception, social anxiety, virtual realism, job\r\ninterview phobia\r\n1 Introduction\r\n\r\nVirtual Reality (VR) is now a promising concept for psychologi-\r\ncal therapy. Researches over the years have successfully demon-\r\nstrated the potential of using a virtual reality system for therapeutic\r\n\r\npurposes in various psychological conditions. Unlike conventional\r\n\r\npsychological therapies, a virtual reality system allows individu-\r\nals to be exposed to the fear stimulating situations in a controlled\r\n\r\nenvironment. It helps individuals to gradually adjust to their fear\r\nenvironment, and build up confidence to manage their upcoming\r\npsychological struggle [Riva 2003].\r\n\r\nOne fear which is wide spread in any community is anxiety re-\r\nlated to job interviews. This is particularly true in student popu-\r\nlations who are close to finishing their degrees and are faced with\r\n\r\n∗\r\ne-mail: J.H.Kwon@warwick.ac.uk\r\n†\r\ne-mail:A.G.Chalmers@warwick.ac.uk\r\n‡\r\ne-mail:S.Czanner@warwick.ac.uk\r\n§\r\ne-mail:G.Czanner@warwick.ac.uk\r\n¶\r\ne-mail:John.Powell@warwick.ac.uk\r\n\r\nthe prospect of their first ever job interview which could well de-\r\ntermine their future careers. Career services at Universities are in-\r\nundated with requests for ”mock interviews” to help students gain\r\n\r\nsome interview experience. A virtual job interview environment\r\n\r\nwould enable students to gain valuable experience at a time conve-\r\nnient to them, while at the same time relieving the burden on the\r\n\r\ncareer services.\r\nThis paper investigates what the impact of the level of realism of\r\nthe virtual avatar performing the interview is on the anxiety levels\r\nof the interviewee.\r\n2 Related Work\r\nWith the rise in social interest in the fear of social interaction, North\r\n\r\net al. developed a VR therapeutic tool for the fear of public speak-\r\ning in 1998 [North et al. 1998]. This tool comprised a virtual audito-\r\nrium including audiences and audio clips that were programmed to\r\n\r\nrespond to the speaker. The study measured the level of anxiety in\r\nthe participants with self-reported questionnaires and demonstrated\r\nthe possibility of virtual reality in managing social phobia. Since\r\n\r\nthen, studies have not only shown the efficacy of virtual reality ex-\r\nposure therapy, but have also highlighted the requirement of further\r\n\r\nresearch in relation to a virtual avatar and human psych.\r\n\r\nThere have been several studies conducted to find a correlation be-\r\ntween anxiety and 3D virtual avatars in a fear stimulating virtual\r\n\r\nenvironment. Pertaub [Pertaub and C. 2001] compared the anxiety\r\nlevels of 43 people, who suffered from the fear of public speaking,\r\nand had been exposed to one of either neutral, positive or hostile 3D\r\naudiences. High levels of anxiety were induced in all participants\r\nand a less sense of satisfaction was felt by those who were exposed\r\nto the hostile audience than the others. Subsequently this research\r\nteam [Slater et al. 2004] evaluated the responses of self reported\r\nquestionnaires between phobic and non-phobic groups after they\r\nhad been exposed to either a group of virtual humans or an empty\r\nseminar room. In the result of this study, the levels of anxiety were\r\n\r\nfound to be low in the non-phobics in both situations, but signifi-\r\ncantly higher in phobics in comparison to non-phobics when they\r\n\r\nwere exposed to the empty seminar room and even higher when\r\n\r\nthey were speaking in front of a group of indifferent virtual hu-\r\nmans. Moreover, in 2003, James [James et al. 2003] presented 10\r\n\r\npeople to either a London tube or Wine bar simulation. The results\r\nof this study suggested that anxiety was generated within an overly\r\nhostile social setting despite the lack of realism of avatars.\r\nAlthough these previous studies have carried out to understand the\r\ninteraction between virtual human and anxiety felt by individuals\r\non exposure to a social interaction, it is still unclear as to how much\r\nrealism of virtual humans is required for provoking anxiety in a\r\nvirtual job interview simulation, and what the individual’s anxiety\r\noccurrence vary in between different graphic fidelity of avatar. This\r\nunderstanding might be very useful to enhance the beneficial effects\r\nto the construction of VR application for therapeutic use. The study\r\n167\r\n\r\npresented in this paper is focused primarily on the relationship be-\r\ntween the degree of anxiety and the realism of virtual human, and\r\n\r\nalso investigates the change of anxiety in accordance with virtual\r\nhuman’s attitudes during a job interview simulation. The aims were\r\n\r\napproached by the observation of individual’s eye avoidance be-\r\nhavioural tendency in different conditions of virtual environments.\r\n\r\n3 Experiment Setup\r\n\r\nFigure1 and 2 show the virtual environment that comprised a vir-\r\ntual office and the interviewer. The interviewers were designed\r\n\r\nwith three different levels of realism: a realistic 3D virtual hu-\r\nman, a cartoon-like 3D virtual human and a human photograph (See\r\n\r\nfigure2).\r\n\r\nFigure 1: The Virtual Office\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Different fidelity levels of virtual humans were used (from\r\nleft to right) Human photo (VR1), Cartoonish 3D human (VR2),\r\nand Realistic 3D human (VR3)\r\n\r\nThe human photo (VR1) was displayed as a texture. The tex-\r\nture that was used correlated to three photographs of a real in-\r\nterviewer that represented neutral, negative, and positive postures\r\n\r\n3. The model of the realistic 3D human (VR3) was created using\r\nAutodesk’s Maya software package, and rendered by the real-time\r\nrendering engine (Virtools) for a dynamic simulation. To simulate\r\n\r\nlife-like attitudes and gestures, the virtual interviewers were articu-\r\nlated figures that were modelled with a layered hierarchy: a virtual\r\n\r\nskin was attached to an underlying skeleton that animated the whole\r\nbody. The skeleton consisted of a number of segments (such as the\r\narms, fingers, and feet), which were connected to each other by\r\n\r\nthe joints. The animation of the skeleton was performed by four-\r\ndimensional matrices guided by inverse kinematics and key-frame\r\n\r\nanimation. In addition to obtain a high degree of realism for facial\r\n\r\nanimations, we used a deformation technique such as bland shape.\r\nOn the other hands, the cartoon-likes 3D human was created by the\r\nsame techniques as the VR3, but in much less detail and with a view\r\nto a cartoon artistic guidance.\r\nThe virtual interviewer asked 9 general job interview questions in\r\n\r\nany sequence to all participants.The interview questions were de-\r\nlivered by 2.1ch audio output. The interview questions were;\r\n\r\n1. What have you most enjoyed about being at university?\r\n2. Why do you want to work for us?\r\n3. Give me an example of where you have had to work on a\r\nproblem in a team.\r\n4. How do you cope under pressure? Give me an example of\r\nwhere you have had to cope in this way.\r\n5. Tell me about a time when you used your skills of persuasion\r\nto convince someone of your ideas.\r\n6. How has your work experience informed your commercial\r\nawareness?\r\n7. Tell me about a time when you made a mistake and overcame\r\nit? What did you learn from the experience?\r\n8. What newspaper do you read and why?\r\n9. Where do you see yourself in five year’s time?\r\n\r\nWhen participants were delivering their own answers to the inter-\r\nviewer, for every three questions the interviewer reacted firstly neu-\r\ntral (e.g. smiling or nodding), secondly negative (e.g. head-shaking,\r\n\r\nyawning, and turning head away with the sound of sigh, and neg-\r\native speaking ’Ok, I heard enough’) and finally positive anima-\r\ntion (smiling and interlocking fingers and interested looking with\r\n\r\npositive speaking ’That sounds interesting, could you tell me more\r\nplease’). Moreover, for interrupting the continuity of participants’\r\nanswers, if it was too long, we implemented several breaking-off\r\nsounds such as e.g. Thanks for your answer or Ok, I am going to go\r\nto the next question. All the selection of the sounds and animations\r\nwere able to be operated by the investigator at any time during the\r\njob interview (See figure3)\r\nTo compromise between real time constraints and visual quality, we\r\n\r\nused Virtools (VR-engine) that allowed us to develop fully inter-\r\nactive VR environment with a built in behaviour rendering engine\r\n\r\n(Shaders 3.0, HLSL and CgFX, DX 9.c and OpenGL 2.0) and pre-\r\nscripted module (Behaviour Building Block). Although the SDK\r\n\r\nis less flexible to create complex custom behaviours and access the\r\nAPI, it has been adopted a graphical interface with drag and drop\r\nprogramming method for a less technical software developer. The\r\n3D models that designed by Maya software were directly exported\r\n\r\nto Virtools using Maya-Virtools export plug-in, and then the 3D ob-\r\njects were reassigned a materials and textures, and redefined char-\r\nacter animations and sounds to be controlled by input devices (e.g.\r\n\r\nkeyboard and mouse). The developed virtual job interview simu-\r\nlation was rendered by NVIDIA Geforce 8800 GT with the reso-\r\nlution mode of 1280X800X32@60Hz, and presented in a 57 inch\r\n\r\nLCD TV. As described at figure 4, the VR system was synchronised\r\nto an eye tracking system through User Datagram Protocol(UDP)\r\nnetwork for recording animation event time accurately. Two video\r\ncameras were utilised one for recording subject’s facial ex<x>pression\r\nand the other one for recording subject’s vision that combined with\r\neye tracker. (See Figure 4).\r\nIt is well known that the escape and avoidance behaviours are\r\nwidely applied in social anxiety. In particular, the avoidance of\r\n\r\neye contact is the one of the major symptoms among socially anx-\r\nious people. Moreover, the eye contact is the one of the imperative\r\n\r\n168\r\n\r\nFigure 3: The examples of different reactions of virtual humans\r\nwere used (from Top to Bottom) Neutral, Positive, and Negative\r\ninfluences on a job interview. The frequent of eye-contact elicits\r\npositive interviewer evaluations and interview outcomes [Stevens\r\n\r\nand Kristof 1995]. Nevertheless, most population experience anx-\r\niety and not easy to maintain eye contact during a job interview,\r\n\r\nparticularly with strangers and even more whose are in a position\r\nof authority [Hollandsworth et al. 1978]. Furthermore, the rate of\r\neye-blink has been found to increase when anxiety, stress or arousal\r\n\r\nis experienced [Harrigan and O’Connell 1996]. The increased eye-\r\nblink is associated with increased sympathetic nervous system ac-\r\ntivity, and increases in both are related to participants’ attempts to\r\n\r\nsuppress felt emotion [Gross and Levenson 1993]. These anxiety\r\nbehaviour tendencies can be measured by an eye tracker, and it has\r\nbeen validated by Glilion [Grillon et al. 2006] and Horley [Horley\r\net al. 2003]. We thus focused more on subject’s eye behaviours and\r\nutilised a Facelab’s eye tracker, a web camera (800 × 600) and a\r\nvideo recorder (6mm digital) in order to observe and measure the\r\ngaze avoidance behaviours of subjects including gaze movement,\r\nblinking and other symptoms related to the response of avoidance\r\nbehaviour.\r\nAfter collecting the time each subject spent with their gaze fixed\r\non the interviewer’s face in the general eyes and mouth area, we\r\ncalculated the percent rate of gaze fixation during each question by\r\nthe following equation:\r\nRGF =\r\n\r\nTime o f GF\r\nETimeo f Q−STimeo f Q\r\n×100\r\n\r\n, where\r\n• RGF: The percent rate of gaze fixation\r\n• Time of GF: the time each subject’s of gaze fixation on the\r\ninterviewer’s face\r\n• ETime of Q: the end of time in each question\r\n\r\n• STime of Q: the start of time in each question\r\nSimilarly, the percent rate of blinking in each job interview question\r\nwas also calculated by the equation:\r\nREB =\r\n\r\nNumber o f EB\r\nETimeo f Q−STimeo f Q\r\n×100\r\n\r\n, where\r\n• REB: The percent rate of eye blink\r\n• Number of EB: The number of each subject’s of eye blink\r\n• ETime of Q: the end of time in each question\r\n• STime of Q: the start of time in each question\r\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) test as a major statistical analysis\r\nmethod was used to evaluate the mean difference for dependent\r\n\r\nvariables (RGF and REB) in various VR conditions of virtual hu-\r\nman. To ensure the level of confidence the mean comparisons for\r\n\r\ndifferent levels of independent variables were done by using a mul-\r\ntiple comparison procedure with Scheffe correction.\r\n\r\nFigure 4: The Architecture of Experiment Setup\r\n\r\n4 Results\r\nSixty volunteer subjects (29 male and 31 female) were recruited\r\nfrom the university students with following ethnic backgrounds\r\nage 21-34 (mean=25.95 and SD=2.84), 47 Asian (Thai, Chinese,\r\n\r\nJapanese, Indian, and Korean) and 13 European (French, Span-\r\nish, Italian, Slovakian, Norwegian, and British). All participants\r\n\r\nwere equivalently allocated into three different groups for expo-\r\nsure: Realistic 3D virtual human (VR3), cartoon-like 3D virtual\r\n\r\nhuman (VR2), and human photograph (VR1). Two self-reported\r\nquestionnaires: Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE)\r\n[Leary 1983] and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSA)[Liebowitz\r\n1987] were implemented as a screening instrument to identify the\r\nseverity of participant’s anxiety in real life. The total average score\r\nin each scale was 24.33 out of total 60 in BFNES and 52.95 out of\r\ntotal 144 in LSAS. The scores were not met to diagnosis any social\r\nanxiety tendency, and the average scores of both scales in between\r\ngroups were not different at 5% level of significance.\r\n169\r\n\r\n4.1 The sequence of gaze fixation\r\nWe characterised the anxiety during the interviews via the times\r\n\r\nsubjects spent fixating on the virtual interviewer’s face, i.e. the sub-\r\nject’s gaze fixation. This was further discussed in Section 3. The\r\n\r\nfollowing graphs clearly describe how the mean value of the rate of\r\ngaze fixation (MRGF) varies according to each question during the\r\nwhole virtual job interview session.\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Mean of RGF in VR1 (2D photograph interviewer)\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Mean of RGF in VR2 (3D cartoonish interviewer)\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Mean of RGF in VR3 (3D human interviewer)\r\nFirst we studied the participant’s response for the percent rate gaze\r\nfixation time (RGF) in interviews with a human photo (VR1). The\r\nRGF at which the participants looked at the interviewer’s face was\r\nchanging over time. The mean more than doubled (2.6) during the\r\n\r\nfirst three neutral questions when the participant looked at the neu-\r\ntral photograph. Then the gaze rate was slowly decreasing during\r\n\r\nthe session when the participant had to face an interviewer’s photo\r\n\r\nwith negative face. In addition, the mean of the RGF was slowly de-\r\ncreased to -0.13 for the rest of responses (positive reaction) during\r\n\r\nlast three questions.\r\nA similar tendency of results was found in VR3. Although there\r\nwas a slight difference in gradient, it showed a clear decline in the\r\nmean of RGF for the whole three interviewers between the 4th and\r\n6th questions, where virtual interviewers reacted negatively. From\r\nthe graphs, we observed that all types of virtual interviewer had\r\nsuccessfully elicited a reduction in time participants spent with their\r\ngaze fixation on interviewer’s face when the interviewer performed\r\nnegative reactions. It appeared that across all virtual avatars, the 3D\r\nhuman tended to have strongest effect on the participant’s anxiety\r\nduring the negative session. The participants’ gaze fixation percent\r\nrate showed the greatest drop, indicating the highest anxiety level\r\n(face avoidance).\r\nWe tested via ANOVA whether the observed differences for RGF\r\n\r\nacross interviewer’s types were statistically significant. The aver-\r\nage of RGF are 22.44, 23.34, and 21.61, during a interview with\r\n\r\nthe type of VR1, VR2 and VR3 avatar respectively. Although\r\nVR3 elicited the lowest average of RGF amongst the three avatars,\r\nthe differences between them were not found to be significant\r\n(p=0.538) at 5% level of significance.\r\nNext, we wanted to confirm that the negative reaction of virtual\r\n\r\ninterviewer decreases a participant’s gaze fixation time. We com-\r\npared the mean RGF in the three types of virtual interviewer’s reac-\r\ntion and evaluated them by the ANOVA test. We found strong evi-\r\ndence that gaze rate (RGF) significantly changed across three types\r\n\r\nof interviewer’s reactions (p=0.029). Using a multiple comparison\r\nprocedure with Scheffe correction we found that the participants\r\nlooked at interviewer’s face least often during the negative session\r\n(mean = 20.4). This was significantly smaller (p=0.013) than the\r\n\r\ngaze rate during neutral (mean=24.5) and positive (mean=22.4) ses-\r\nsions. Further, no significant difference (p=0.999) in mean of RGF\r\n\r\nwas found between neutral and positive sessions at the 5% level of\r\nsignificance.\r\nSince the mean RGF was found to be different across interviewer’s\r\nreaction types, we next investigated if this property of mean RGF\r\n\r\nwas shared for each of the virtual interviewer. We therefore eval-\r\nuated the mean difference of RGF between interviewer’s reaction\r\n\r\ntypes for each virtual avatar separately. ANOVA test confirmed\r\nthat VR3 was the only condition where RGF differed between the\r\nnegative and neutral reaction (p=0.001) at 5% level of significance,\r\nTable 1.\r\n(I) Reaction (J) Reaction Mean Diff.(I-J) Std. Error Sig.\r\nnegative neutral -8.54483(*) 2.34991 .001\r\npositive -4.76600 2.34991 .126\r\nneutral negative 8.54483(*) 2.34991 .001\r\npositive 3.77883 2.34991 .294\r\npositive negative 4.76600 2.34991 .126\r\nneutral -3.77883 2.34991 .294\r\n\r\n1* The mean difference is significant at the 0.05 level.\r\nTable 1: Multiple Comparisons (Dependent Variable: RGF = VR3)\r\nTo summarise, we found that the time for gaze fixation had been\r\naffected more by the reaction types of virtual interviewer than its\r\nvisual realism. Furthermore we discovered that participants tended\r\nto avoid eye contacts more with the realistic 3D interviewer, when\r\nthe interviewer gave negative reactions.\r\n170\r\n\r\n4.2 Frequency of eye blink\r\nEye blinking is another relevant measure of anxiety: the more a\r\nparticipant is stressed and the more he/she blinks. We calculated\r\n\r\nthe average of blinking percent rate (REB) during each of inter-\r\nviewer’s reactions (Neutral, Negative and Positive) and compared\r\n\r\nthem across the different levels of realism (VR1, VR2 and VR3) via\r\nan ANOVA test. This would provide important evidence to identify\r\nwhether the avoidance eye behaviour during the interview session\r\nwas caused by anxiety. The following graphs shows how the mean\r\nof REB varies when participants were exposed to the virtual job\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Mean of REB in VR1 (2D photograph interviewer)\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Mean of REB in VR2 (3D cartoon interviewer)\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Mean of REB in VR3 (3D human interviewer)\r\nFrom the graphs, the value of the mean REB shows very similar\r\ncurves over the different types of virtual interviewer. In all VRs\r\n\r\nthe blinking rate was low between the 1st and 3rd; and between the\r\n7th and 9th question. This suggests whether the negative virtual\r\ninterviewer tended to elicit higher frequency of eye blinks, which\r\nwere are a sign of higher anxiety.\r\nIn order to explore this tendency with statistical analysis, we first\r\nstudied the differences of REB across VR1, VR2 and VR3. The\r\nmean of eye blinking percent rates were 36.22, 37.70 and 37.15\r\n\r\nduring the whole job interview session for VR1, VR2 and VR3 re-\r\nspectively. These differences were found not to be significant at\r\n\r\nthe 5% level. Next, in order to identify whether there is a mean\r\ndifference for REB within the three types of reaction of the virtual\r\ninterviewer, an ANOVA test was computed. The mean of REB was\r\nhigher for negative (M. negative = 38.34) reactions than for other\r\ntypes (M. positive = 35.78 and M. neutral = 36.95), however, only\r\nthe mean difference between the positive and negative (p=0.000)\r\nreactions was significant at the 5% level of significance. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe repeated the ANOVA test to see whether it showed the same re-\r\nsult in each type of virtual interviewer. In the case of VR1 or VR2,\r\n\r\nthere was no mean difference for REB among the type of reaction.\r\nHowever, the mean difference for REB was significant (p=0.03) in\r\nthe group of VR3, see Table 2. This comparison showed that only\r\n\r\nthe 3D human interviewer induced the increase in REB when it per-\r\nformed negatively.\r\n\r\n(I) Reaction (J) Reaction Mean Diff.(I-J) Std.

In order to investigate our hy-\r\npothesis, we developed three varying levels of realistic fidelity of\r\n\r\nthe virtual interviewer. Participants were exposed to a virtual job\r\ninterview situation with nine job interview questions. During the\r\n\r\njob interview, we simulated the virtual interviewer providing neu-\r\ntral, negative, and positive reactions. After comparing the mean\r\n\r\ndifference for the percent rate of gaze fixation and eye blinking, we\r\ngenerally noticed that the anxiety level was affected more by the\r\nattitude of the virtual interviewer than its level of realism.\r\nFrom the results of our experiment, we have three main findings.\r\nFirst, we could not find any significant difference in the mean for\r\n\r\na participant’s gaze fixation rate and eye blinking rate together be-\r\ntween the varying levels of virtual interviewer fidelity. However, we\r\n\r\nidentified that the mean for both responses was significant when the\r\n\r\nparticipants were interviewed with the negative performing 3D hu-\r\nman interviewer. Based on these results, we could conclude the re-\r\nalism of virtual avatar may be related to anxiety levels, but it seems\r\n\r\nthe high fidelity of virtual reality is not a critical factor in increasing\r\nthe anxiety levels in a virtual environment.\r\nSecondly, participants responded similarly in both gaze fixation rate\r\n\r\nand eye blinking rate to a virtual interviewer’s neutral and posi-\r\ntive reactions, and the mean difference was not significant between\r\n\r\nthem. This can be interpreted in that either we failed to design\r\npure positive reactions , or that participants were more concerned\r\n171\r\n\r\nabout the interviewer’s negative reaction than neutral or positive re-\r\nactions. However, we could not find any evidences from the result\r\n\r\nof this study to evaluate this assumption, so this issue is open for\r\nfurther investigation.\r\n\r\nFinally, measuring an individual’s eye behaviour may be a promis-\r\ning tool to identify the anxiety level while people are exposed to\r\n\r\na virtual social simulation. The eye tracker gave us very detailed\r\nvisual results and allowed us to acquire a qualitative appraisal of an\r\nindividual’s eye behaviour. In addition, we found that the response\r\n\r\nof blinking was a more sensitive tool than gaze avoidance. Fur-\r\nthermore, we observed that the blinking response increased within\r\n\r\na few seconds after participant was exposed to anxiety stimulating\r\nevents.\r\n6 Conclusions\r\nWe can conclude that the visual realism of avatar used in the job\r\ninterview simulation may be related to a less eye-contact and more\r\n\r\nrate of blinking, but this tendency of anxiety behaviour is more re-\r\nlated to the attitudes of virtual humans. This conclusion might con-\r\nsolidate to Pertaub’s finding [Pertaub and C. 2001] that participants\r\n\r\nfelt more comfortable with a positive group of avatars and experi-\r\nenced substantial distress with an unpleasant audience. In addition,\r\n\r\nthis result should contribute to the development of more effective\r\nvirtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety disorders.\r\nIn the future we will evaluate the relationship between other types\r\nof interaction from the virtual avatar and the environment itself,\r\nincluding voice tone or speech, smell and lighting and its affect on\r\nthe social anxiety of the participant. We will also consider other\r\nphysiological measurements such as Electroencephalography and\r\nElectromyography for facial emotion.\r\n7 Acknowledgement\r\nWe would like to thank Dr. Jenny O’leary (The Centre of Warwick\r\n\r\nCareer Service) for her contributions (see avatar photograph), use-\r\nful comments and suggestions throughout the study.'),

INTRODUCTION\r\nAutism is a lifelong pervasive developmental disorder affecting\r\nsocial, communication and reasoning skills [1]. Formally, it is\r\nconsidered that autism consists of “triad of impairments”:\r\ni. A social impairment: it is very hard for a person with\r\nautism to relate to and empathize with other people;\r\nii. a communication impairment: understanding and\r\nusing verbal and non-verbal signals is very hard for\r\npersons with autism, displaying behaviour considered\r\nsocially or emotionally inappropriate and\r\niii. a tendency towards rigidity and inflexibility in\r\nthinking, language and behaviour.\r\nPeople with autism have a limited range of imaginative activities\r\nand face difficulties in making sense of the social world [2]. In\r\naddition, they have problems in understanding and using both\r\nverbal and non-verbal communication channels. Finally, autism\r\nis characterized with rigidness in thinking, language and\r\nbehaviour. It is agreed that the common individualities of autism\r\nare abnormal reaction to input stimuli, lack of human\r\nengagement and inability to generalize between environments\r\n[3]. Education is considered as the most proper solution for the\r\nproblem of autism. Early stage education might autistic persons\r\nin coping with the “theory of mind deficit – difficulty in\r\nunderstanding mental states of others and ascribing them to\r\nthemselves or others” [4]. Computers have been considered as a\r\npromising educational aiding for autistic persons. One of the\r\nfirst experiments took place in the early 1960’s. Colby had some\r\n\r\ninitial success in using computers to instill an interest in speech-\r\nrelated sounds and language in mute children with autism [5.].\r\n\r\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\r\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\r\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that\r\ncopies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Nowadays,\r\nwith the advancement of Information and Communication\r\nTechnologies (ICT), computer-aided learning or instruction\r\n(CAL/CAI) is considered as a key method for handling autism\r\ninterventions, particularly for young children.\r\nActing not only as machines (objects) but also as if they were\r\npeople (subjects), computers represent a considerable and\r\nvaluable part of the educational techniques [6]. According to the\r\nliterature, autistic persons, children in particular, enjoy\r\ninteracting with computers since they are experienced as “safe”\r\n[7]. This stems from the theory that computers are not having\r\nthe expectations and judgments that make social interaction\r\nproblematic for autistic persons. Recent literature reveals that\r\ncomputer systems represent a controlled environment with\r\nminimum or no distractions that is crucial in the education\r\nprocess for autistic children [8]. It has been reported that in\r\ninteractions with computers, children with autism can feel\r\ncertain level of control over the environment, which cannot\r\nhappen when interacting with human beings [9]. Moreover, this\r\nfeeling of control is independent of the type of software\r\ninterface and is said to be generic to all interactions with\r\ncomputers.\r\nMost of the software platforms use entertaining content in\r\neducational settings in order to present knowledge in an\r\nattractive way. This synergy is often called “edutainment” [10].\r\nThis paper presents an evaluation of the edutainment platform\r\nfor autistic children – Affective Computer-Aided Learning\r\nPlatform for Children with Autism (ACALPA) [11]. The\r\nplatform supports edutainment method using an affective avatar,\r\nsynthesized speech and multimedia content (videos, images and\r\nsounds). The main goal of the platform is to facilitate the\r\nteacher-child learning scheme where the users will be both the\r\nteachers and the children with autism. Therefore, the evaluation\r\nprocess is primarily focused on the impact of the platform as\r\nseen by the educators. The goal is to evaluate the\r\nimplementation of recent advances in research, theory and\r\ntechnology (affective avatars, speech etc.). Thirteen educators of\r\nautistic people participated in the study. The evaluation included\r\na questionnaire oriented towards to the feedback they received\r\nfrom the autistic people within a one-month period of usage as\r\nan educational tool.\r\n2. RELATED WORK\r\nRecent research and literature reveals that virtual reality systems\r\nand collaborative virtual environments utilizing emotionally\r\nexpressive avatars can facilitate people with autism by means of\r\nan assistive technology, an educational technology or a\r\ntherapeutic technology [12]. Avatars express their mental and\r\nemotional state especially via facial ex<x>pressions. Recent research\r\nintroduces that because these avatars’ emotions are highly\r\ndistinctive and easily recognizable people with autism appear to\r\nunderstand and to use them appropriately [13]. Moreover,\r\nfindings in psychology and neurology suggest that emotions are\r\nalso an important factor in decision-making, problem solving,\r\ncognition and intelligence in general. [13]. Picard signalized that\r\nthe emotional state of others affects not only our own emotional\r\nstate, but directly the decisions we make [14]. Another area\r\nwhere emotions are used is that of learning. It has been argued\r\n\r\nthat the ability to show emotions through body language ensures\r\nthe quality of tutor-learner and learner-learner interaction [15].\r\nFurthermore, most of the educational platforms that have been\r\ndeveloped in order to satisfy the educators and the persons with\r\nautism focus on their unique learning styles. Current literature\r\nindicates that there is a high level of use of special education\r\nsoftware [16] However, teachers working with young learners\r\nwho are autistic, report significant shortcomings with a large\r\nnumber of software platforms in use in their classrooms.\r\nDifficulties that have come to light include insufficient error\r\ncontrol, inappropriate audio feedback on error, and other user\r\nproblems [16].\r\nTherefore, although software design remains poorly\r\ndocumented, several experimental studies have shown the\r\nusefulness of computers for autism [17]. Psychopathologists\r\nexpress growing interest in using computers for special\r\neducation of autistic people [18]. Besides that, parents were\r\namong the first to develop computer-based approaches for this\r\npurpose [19].\r\n3. THE SYSTEM\r\nACALPA is a platform that is intended to enhance or mediate\r\nthe teacher-child educational process [11]. It is based on various\r\ninteraction procedures according to the disability level of the\r\nautistic person in question. Several modules comprise the\r\nplatform. Each of them represents a specific learning domain.\r\nNamely, there are modules where the child is asked to identify\r\nthe correct image between two or more images, to put images in\r\nthe correct sequence (according to time), identify emotions by\r\nvisual ex<x>pressions etc. Furthermore, the more complex modules\r\nare in the form of semi-virtual environments. They provide the\r\nchild with the ability to interact in a safe and controlled way.\r\nThe theme of each module varies from objects in the normal\r\nsurroundings, everyday use objects, colours, words etc. The\r\ninstructions are given either by an affective avatar, synthesized\r\nspeech in autistic person’s native language (in the specific\r\nexample - Greek), written in the screen, by the corresponding\r\nmakaton symbol or a combination of these. Additionally, the\r\navatar can express emotions depending on the situations, e.g.\r\nhappiness when the correct image is selected, sadness if not. The\r\ninstructions and the difficulty level can be personalised for each\r\nuser. User input/feedback is facilitated by means of a mouse\r\ninteraction, a touch screen or large buttons attached to the\r\ncomputer.\r\nEqually important function of the platform is the recording of\r\nthe interaction/education process in a database. Consequently,\r\nthe educators are enabled with track record of the users’\r\nprogress and modify the difficulty levels accordingly.\r\nAdditionally, an educator may register specific educational or\r\npersonality data for each autistic person. The printable format of\r\nall the records (Fig. 1) enables easy monitoring and analysis of\r\nthe learning process. In this way, a longitudinal record may be\r\nachieved indicating “a learning curve” for each autistic person\r\nseparately, thereby enhancing and normalising the educational\r\nprocedures toward each person’s needs.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 Printable report representing percent of success and\r\ntime of completion of each instance.\r\n4. EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM\r\nThe system was implemented in a specialised school for people\r\nwith autism. The school numbers approximately 50 persons with\r\nautism, ranging from 8 to 30 years of age, but mostly children.\r\nThe persons are educated by thirteen highly specialised\r\neducators. The system was used for a period of one month as\r\npart of the daily educational process. Furthermore, at least one\r\neducator was accompanying a child in the interaction with the\r\nsystem. Meanwhile, children’s progress was tracked through the\r\nreports of the system.\r\nAt the end of the usage period, the teachers were given a\r\nquestionnaire that inspects the main aspects of the platform and\r\nthe edutainment process using the platform. The questionnaire\r\nconsists of the categories shown in Table 1.\r\nTable 1.

Educators suggest\r\nthat most of the times persons with autism are able to recognize\r\nthe avatar’s mental and emotional state provided by facial\r\nex<x>pressions (Fig. 2). Moreover the synthesized speech is\r\nprovided by lips synchronisation of the avatar. Consequently, an\r\navatar speaking in the native language of the autistic persons is\r\nmaking more sense than an avatar without speech. Educators\r\nbelieve that an avatar with native voice is more effective than an\r\navatar without voice (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\nFig. 3 Evaluation of the avatar’s usefulness in the educational\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nAn interesting point which characterized children with autism is\r\nthat they are unable to choose which event is more or less\r\nimportant [20]. As a consequence they are often saturated\r\nbecause of too many stimuli and thus they adopt an extremely\r\nrepetitive, unusual, self-injurious, or aggressive behaviour.\r\nDuring development of the system, educators ask for the\r\nsoftware not to be complex. For instance, if a child should\r\ndistinguish a dog from a cat, the multimedia material should\r\ndepict only the dog and the cat, without extra background\r\ninformation. For this reason the multimedia material is as simple\r\nas possible by providing clearly the main objects. By this way,\r\nthe system helps children with autism to focus their attention on\r\na specific task. On the other hand, educators have the ability to\r\nexperiment by providing inchmeal more complex themes.\r\nEvaluation of the results indicates that although most of the\r\ntimes the multimedia material attracts autistic persons only in\r\nsome of them the autistic persons are not complicated (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nFig. 4 The content presented by the system appears to be\r\nattractive and not complex for autistic people.\r\nMoreover, one of the goals of our investigation was to examine\r\nif the system is able to support techniques and methods that are\r\nused in autistic persons’ education. For example, the TEACCH\r\nintervention program (Treatment and Education of Autistic and\r\nrelated Communication handicapped CHildren) involves a\r\nstructured teaching approach and the use of visual materials.\r\nTEACCH is providing services for autistic people by making\r\nuse of various associated techniques depending upon the\r\nindividual person\'s needs [21]. TEACCH principles involve\r\nchanging the behaviour and skill level of the person as well as\r\ndeveloping an environment that matches the person’s needs.\r\nTEACCH is a structured technique especially targeting to the\r\nperson’s visual processing strengths by organizing the\r\nenvironment and providing a visual conduct to supply\r\ninformation about activities. Visual structure is provided at a\r\nvariety of levels such as organizing areas of the environment,\r\nproviding a daily schedule using pictures or written words, as\r\nwell as visual instructions and visual organization signalling the\r\nbeginning and end of tasks. This technique is based upon the\r\nobservation that children with autism learn and connect\r\ninformation differently than other children. Accepting this\r\nmethod’s principles while developing the system, the educators\r\nwere asked for a feedback about the system’s ability to support\r\nmethods used in education of autistic persons. Most of the\r\n\r\neducators agreed that the structure and the content of the system\r\nare formed in the right way so as to make it capable of\r\nsupporting the TEACCH method (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\nFig. 5 Most of the educators agree that the system is capable\r\nof supporting the TEACCH method.\r\nDuring the initial stage of the system development, interviews\r\nwith educators of autistic persons revealed that the feedback\r\nprovided to the autistic persons during educational process plays\r\nan essential role. Based on this, the system approach on a\r\nsuccessful answer is integrated by means of the avatar’s happy\r\nemotion, a voice telling “Bravo” or “Well done” and sound of\r\napplause. On the contrary, the avatar, with a sad face,\r\nencourages the user to try again. Not only has the type of the\r\nfeedback but also the timing played essential role in keeping the\r\npersons attention. Moreover, in both occasions, the avatar uses\r\nthe autistic person’s name; an ability that stems from the\r\npersonalized system’s architecture. On our survey, most of the\r\neducators showed a positive impact on the feedback that is\r\nprovided by our system. Most of them agreed that the feedback\r\nis suited in the appropriate form, although it should be more\r\nhelpful in case of a wrong answer. As a result, the feedback\r\napproach we followed appears to suit the needs of the user with\r\nautism (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nFig. 6 The feedback of the avatar provided in the right way\r\n\r\nAs described in the introduction of this paper, mush recent\r\neducational research focuses on teaching and learning by means\r\nof the usage of personal computers. According to the current\r\nliterature, persons with autism enjoy interacting with computers.\r\nThis stems from the lack of expectations and judgments by the\r\npersonal computer. This “safe” environment acts as a catalyst in\r\nthe educational process. Bernard-Optiz et al. [22] studied\r\ntraining procedures with software used for social behavior\r\neducation. The study carried out in two different groups of\r\nchildren: a group of children with autism and a group of\r\nchildren without autism. Children had to find a solution to\r\ndifferent scenarios involving characters in problematic social\r\nconflicts. While the performances of both groups improved, the\r\nprogression of the group without autism was steadier.\r\nResults suggested that autistic persons are more interested in\r\nusing a personal computer (independently of the software) rather\r\nthan playing with other kind of games or toys.\r\n\r\nFig. 7 Persons with autism are more interested in interacting\r\nwith a personal computer rather than playing with other\r\ntypes of games or toys.\r\nIn our try to evaluate our software (ACALPA) as for the variety,\r\nthe quality and the impact to the user’s mental state, related\r\ngroups of questions were included to the questionnaire.\r\nEducators believe that the variety and the quality of the content\r\nthat is represented by the software are able to support the\r\neducational approach we followed. Moreover, the evaluation of\r\nthe results on our survey indicates that in most of the cases the\r\nsystem encourages the autistic person (Fig. 8). A more\r\ninteresting finding is the persuasion of the educators that the\r\nsystem is able not only to provide but also to motivate social\r\nactivities among the autistic persons and collaboration in term of\r\ngroups. In addition, the level of creativity is increasing in most\r\nof the cases\r\n\r\nFig. 8 Educators believe that the system suits the educational\r\nneeds\r\n5. CONCLUSION\r\nThis study demonstrates that an interactive learning environment\r\nmight facilitate the educational procedure for people with\r\nautism.\r\nThirteen educators of autistic persons used our platform\r\n(ACALPA) for a month. The questionnaire provided by them\r\nreveals that using of avatars in such system is promising for\r\npeople with autism. Moreover, avatar’s emotional ex<x>pressions,\r\nprovided in a safe environment, makes autistic persons\r\nunderstand the emotional state more easily. Furthermore,\r\neducators believe that when the avatar is accompanied by a\r\nsynthesized speech in the autistic’s native language the\r\neducational processes are facilitated in a more proper way.\r\nIn addition, the multimedia content plays essential role in the\r\nprocedure. Based on the results, content must be not only\r\nattractive but also simple in order not to complicate the persons\r\nwith autism. Moreover, it should contain content from variety\r\nactivities of the daily life. In this way, autistic persons don’t lose\r\ntheir interest during the game.\r\nAnother point is that supporting of techniques and methods that\r\nare used in autistic persons’ education, such as TEACCH, gives\r\nthe ability to the educators to integrate a large amount of\r\ninformation in a more organized way.\r\nFinally, the appropriate feedback of the software during the\r\ninteraction with the autistic person is very important. Our system\r\nprovides the appropriate feedback, in the appropriate time by a\r\nhelpful form. The feedback is provided by means of the avatar,\r\nthe synthesized speech, text, makaton symbol, sound or\r\ncombination of them.\r\nFurther work includes usage or designing of different type of\r\napplications in order to capture autistic person’s movements as a\r\nfactor of their behaviour [23]. Automated capture technologies\r\nand the associated access interfaces for exploring past\r\nexperiences are particularly promising for monitoring the\r\neffectiveness educational systems for behavioural and learning\r\ndisabilities in children [24].\r\n\r\n6.

Erin, one of the humanlike virtual agents we used in our study\r\nwhich examined how virtual agents could use their gaze effectively in an\r\neducational scenario. Here Erin is giving a lecture on geographical locations\r\nof ancient China.\r\nthese attributes in social interactions might enable designers\r\nto create more effective virtual agents in these domains.\r\nGaze cues are an important subset of the embodied cues that\r\npeople employ in social interactions. Using gaze cues, people\r\ncan control the flow of a conversation, indicate interest in or\r\n\r\nappraisal of objects and people, improve listeners’ comprehen-\r\nsion, express complex emotions, and facilitate interpersonal\r\n\r\nprocesses [1, 3, 36]. In order to design virtual agents that\r\n\r\nachieve such significant effects, we must first design mecha-\r\nnisms that capture key variables of gaze and generate appropri-\r\nate gaze behaviors. However, creating effective gaze cues for\r\n\r\nvirtual characters is an open challenge, as humans have built\r\nand finessed subtle but complex patterns in which they use\r\nthese cues over thousands of years of evolution and developed\r\na sensitivity to observing them in others [42]. Furthermore,\r\nhow these design variables might be varied to achieve specific\r\n\r\nhigh-level social and cognitive outcomes is not well under-\r\nstood. The goal of our research is to explore how agents\r\n\r\nmight achieve these outcomes through subtle variations in\r\ngaze behaviors and what design variables might enable such\r\nvariations. We contextualize the work presented in this paper\r\nin an educational scenario, in which virtual agents promise\r\nimprovements in affiliation with students and in learning.\r\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that virtual agents can use subtle\r\nvariations in gaze to achieve significant high-level outcomes.\r\nWe present a parametric model that synthesizes appropriate\r\ngaze behaviors and allows for systematic variations in these\r\nbehaviors, which we validated through an online user study\r\nwith 96 participants. Our design of the gaze model draws\r\non research in human physiology, which precisely describes\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 705\r\n\r\nhow humans coordinate various gaze parameters such as the\r\nmovements of the eyes and the head when executing gaze\r\nshifts—the intentional redirection of gaze toward a particular\r\npiece of information in the context of interaction. Gaze shifts\r\nare a fundamental building block of overall gaze behavior.\r\nThrough subtle variation in timing and movement of the head\r\nand eyes, individuals construct a range of high-level behaviors.\r\nOur model of gaze was designed and parameterized in such\r\na way as to provide sufficient control over the subtleties of\r\nhead and eye movements, enabling a virtual agent to naturally\r\ndisplay these behaviors.\r\nWe also present a user study with 20 participants, in which we\r\ninvestigated how a virtual agent (Figure 1) might manipulate\r\nlow-level gaze parameters to achieve high-level effects such\r\nas improved learning and feelings of rapport in a storytelling\r\ncontext. We manipulated the parameters of our gaze model\r\n\r\nto create affiliative gaze—maintaining a head orientation to-\r\nward the participant to emphasize the social interaction [12]—\r\n\r\nand referential gaze—maintaining a head orientation toward\r\nshared visual space to emphasize the information to which\r\nthe speaker is referring [30]. In both cases, the agent looks\r\nat the same targets; the difference lies in the timing and the\r\ndegree to which the agent uses its head or eyes to look at these\r\ntargets. The results showed that these manipulations generated\r\nsignificant social and cognitive effects; the use of affiliative\r\ngaze improved the perceptions of the agent and the use of\r\nreferential gaze increased recall performance.\r\nThe remainder of the paper provides related work on gaze\r\nfrom a number of perspectives, describes our model and a\r\nvalidation study, outlines the design and results of our user\r\nstudy, and discusses our findings and their implications for the\r\ndesign of effective gaze mechanisms for virtual agents.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nGaze is an important social cue that has been studied under\r\na number of different academic disciplines. First we present\r\n\r\nwork in psychology on how humans use their gaze in social in-\r\nteractions, as well as some of the achievable high-level effects\r\n\r\nof gaze. Next we discuss related work on embodied conversa-\r\ntional agents in the computer graphics and HCI literatures.\r\n\r\nGaze in Human Communication\r\nIn general, being gazed at by another person can result in a\r\n\r\nnumber of interesting effects. Gaze is predominantly inter-\r\npreted as being attended to, and depending on the context of\r\n\r\ninteraction, being gazed at can lead to discomfort from feeling\r\nobserved, or lead to genuine social interaction [1]. A person\r\nwho makes increased eye contact is associated with greater\r\nperceived dynamism, likeability, and believability [4]. These\r\n\r\npeople are also seen as more truthful or credible [1]. One illus-\r\ntrative study specifically showed that people who spend more\r\n\r\ntime gazing at an interviewer receive higher socioemotional\r\nevaluations [16]. On the other hand, gaze aversion produces\r\n\r\nconsistently negative effects in impressions of attraction, cred-\r\nibility, and relational communication [5].\r\n\r\nAn important construct in the study of nonverbal behavior\r\nis immediacy, defined as the degree of perceived physical or\r\npsychological closeness between people [37]. Gaze has been\r\n\r\nfound to be a significant component of immediacy, especially\r\n\r\nin the context of improving educational outcomes [21]. Stu-\r\ndents from primary school age through college have been\r\n\r\nshown to learn better when they are gazed at by the lecturer\r\n[41, 47]. Learning in these cases was usually measured by\r\nthe students’ performance on recall tasks. In a similar study,\r\ngazing into the camera during a video link conversation was\r\nshown to increase the recall of the viewer at the other end [14].\r\nGaze’s positive effect on recall is usually attributed to its role\r\nas an arousal stimulus, which increases attentional focus and\r\ntherefore enhances memory [26].\r\nThe above work shows that gaze as a whole can create positive\r\ninteractions and learning effects. Our goal is to investigate how\r\nsubtle parameters of gaze might serve to strengthen or weaken\r\nthese effects. One of these parameters is the alignment of\r\nthe head, which plays a substantial role in shifting a viewer’s\r\nvisual attention [23]. Gazing at someone with the head fully\r\naligned (affiliative gaze) might be perceived differently than\r\ngazing at someone out of the corner of the eyes with the\r\nhead aligned towards information of interest in the context of\r\ninteraction (referential gaze). A virtual agent might be able to\r\nmanipulate this, and other parameters, to achieve specifically\r\ndesired effects.\r\nEmbodied Conversational Agents\r\n\r\nOur work builds on previous research in the area of embod-\r\nied conversational agents. Developing embodied agents that\r\n\r\ncan communicate effectively is a significant area of research.\r\nGiving these agents more complex and human-like behaviors\r\n\r\nhas been a longstanding goal, for example to make inhab-\r\nited interfaces and agents in VR environments more effective\r\n\r\n[40]. The ability to use non-verbal communicative behavior is\r\nvery important as it increases positive feelings of copresence\r\nand familiarity, and in general makes agents more effective\r\ncommunicators [2].\r\nAn agent’s gaze behavior is very important to providing rich\r\ninteractions; well-designed gaze mechanisms–e.g., gazing at\r\nturn-taking boundaries during conversation–can result in more\r\n\r\nefficient task performance and more positive subjective evalu-\r\nations [22]. However, poor gaze behavior can be worse than\r\n\r\nno gaze at all. The positive effects of having an embodied\r\nagent–as opposed to only audio or text–can be completely\r\n\r\nlost if the gaze is very poor or random [15]. Gaze behav-\r\nior of a female virtual agent, when coupled with the agent’s\r\n\r\nappearance, can make the difference between enhancing nega-\r\ntive attitudes toward women or breaking gender stereotypes\r\n\r\n[10]. The high-level effects of gaze discussed above have been\r\nshown to also extend to physical embodiments, such as robots.\r\nFor example, the learning effect of gaze has been observed in\r\nhuman-robot interactions; increased gaze from a storytelling\r\nrobot facilitates greater recall of the story [39].\r\nPrevious work on modeling human gaze to inform the design\r\n\r\nof agents includes the area of turn management [8, 43], figur-\r\ning out where agents should be looking and why they should be\r\n\r\nlooking there [25, 31], or how an agent should make random\r\n\r\neye saccades in idle situations [6] or face-to-face conversa-\r\ntions [32]. Some attempts have been made to model head and\r\n\r\neye motions for virtual agent gaze, including data-driven [9]\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 706\r\n\r\nTarget, Agent,\r\n& Environmental\r\nParameters\r\nHead Latency\r\nParameter\r\n\r\nOMR Head Alignment\r\nPreferences\r\n\r\nVelocity\r\nProles\r\n\r\nHead Movement\r\nEye Movement\r\nKey Input\r\nParameters\r\n\r\nKey Stages of\r\nGaze Shi\r\n\r\nEnd\r\nLatency Period\r\n\r\nEyes Reach\r\nTarget + Start VOR\r\n\r\ntime\r\n\r\nMove Head to Target if (–) Move Head to Target Move Head to Target\r\nMove Eyes to Target if (+) Move Eyes to Target Eyes Engage in VOR\r\n\r\nGaze Shi\r\nComplete\r\n\r\nGaze Shi\r\nStart\r\nB D E\r\n\r\nF\r\n\r\nC\r\n\r\nHead Latency Negative\r\nHead Latency Positive\r\nA\r\n\r\nFigure 2. A visual representation of our model of gaze shifts mapped onto time. Key input variables and processes include (A) target, agent, and environmental\r\nparameters, (B) head latency, (C) velocity profiles for head and eye motion, (D) oculomotor range (OMR) specifications, (E) head alignment preferences, and (F)\r\nthe vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR)1\r\n.\r\n\r\nand procedural [45] approaches, as well as a hybrid between\r\nthe two [29]. In general, existing research has proven that\r\nmore realistic gaze behavior for humanoid avatars results in\r\nconsiderably improved and fluid communication [15]. At the\r\nvery least, simply conveying gaze direction eases turntaking\r\nand is essential to establishing who is talking and listening to\r\nwhom in multiparty mediated communication [50].\r\nWhile previous research has explored how gross manipulations\r\nin gaze behavior might shape user experience and perceptions\r\nof virtual characters, how specific parameters in the control\r\n\r\nspace for gaze might be mapped to specific outcomes in in-\r\nteraction has not been explored. Our work seeks to fill this\r\n\r\nknowledge gap. Our model of gaze, presented next, provides\r\nparameters that work as low-level gaze variables, and allows\r\n\r\nus to investigate their impact on high-level outcomes in a prin-\r\ncipled way. Advantages of our model include its procedural\r\n\r\nsimplicity, grounded nature, and proven ability to produce\r\nlarge objective and subjective high-level effects through the\r\nmanipulation of very subtle parameters.\r\nDESIGNING EFFECTIVE GAZE MECHANISMS\r\nIn order to design virtual agents to be effective communicators,\r\nwe must develop a deeper understanding of how humans use\r\nsubtle gaze behavior to achieve high-level outcomes. We turn\r\nto research in neurophysiology to develop this understanding.\r\n\r\nNeurophysiologists have studied how humans and other pri-\r\nmates coordinate head and eye movements during gaze shifts,\r\n\r\nin the process revealing potential parameters of gaze that might\r\n\r\neventually lead to the positive social outcomes we wish to cre-\r\nate with virtual agents. Here we present the most relevant\r\n\r\nfindings from neurophysiology literature which we combine\r\ninto a model of gaze shifts useful to virtual agents. We also\r\npresent a validation of our model, taking the form of a user\r\nstudy, which shows that virtual agents using the model can\r\nexecute gaze shifts that are both communicative and natural. 1\r\n\r\nGiven the current configuration of the head and eyes and in-\r\nput parameters indicating movement characteristics and tar-\r\nget gaze direction, our model computes a trajectory for the\r\n\r\n1A full specification of the model, including documented pseudocode,\r\nfull details of the validation, and videos of animated characters using\r\nthe model for their own gaze behavior, can be found at http://hci.cs.\r\nwisc.edu/projects/gaze.\r\n\r\nhead and eyes. It first computes a few key variables for the\r\nmovement, and then computes velocities for the head and eye\r\nrotations for each frame of the animated movement, keeping\r\nthe gaze on target until the eyes and head have reached their\r\nfinal target rotations. The model is presented graphically in\r\nFigure 2, and includes six main components: (A) target, agent,\r\n\r\nand environmental parameters, (B) head latency, (C) veloc-\r\nity profiles for head and eye motion, (D) oculomotor range\r\n\r\n(OMR) specifications, (E) head alignment preferences, and (F)\r\nthe vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).\r\nThe first variable to compute when executing a gaze shift is\r\nhead movement latency in relationship to the eye movement\r\n\r\n(Figure 2b). This head latency can vary from person to per-\r\nson and task to task. Factors such as target amplitude, the\r\n\r\npredictability of the target [44], modality of the target (visual\r\nor auditory) [17, 18], target saliency, vigilance of the subject,\r\nand whether the gaze shift is forced or natural [51] have an\r\n\r\neffect. These factors serve as the target, agent, and environ-\r\nmental input parameters to our model (Figure 2a). Our model\r\n\r\nstochastically combines these parameters to determine the\r\nhead latency based on findings from Zangemeister et al. [51].\r\nA positive latency results in a period of eye motion during\r\nwhich the head remains fixed, while a negative latency result\r\nin a period of head motion while the eyes remain fixed.\r\nOnce the head latency period is complete, both the eyes and\r\nhead begin simultaneously moving towards the target. Both\r\nduring and after the latency period, each eye and the head\r\nfollow velocity profiles (Figure 2c) that resemble standard\r\nease-in and ease-out functions [27, 32]. These movements\r\nprevent unnatural head motions caused by high-frequency\r\nsignals [35]. The maximum velocity of the eyes and head—\r\nthe peaks of the velocity profiles—are computed based on\r\npositive linear relationships with the amplitude of the intended\r\ngaze shift [20]. Once the maximum velocity for the gaze shift\r\nis computed, the shift is executed by computing the actual\r\nvelocity for each frame of the animation. The velocity is\r\ndetermined by a piecewise polynomial function derived to\r\napproximate the published experimental data. This polynomial\r\nfunction can be expressed as follows, where g is the proportion\r\nof the gaze shift completed, Vmax is the maximum velocity,\r\nand V is the current calculated velocity.\r\n\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 707\r\n\r\nV =\r\n\r\n2Vmax · g g ∈ [0, 0.5)\r\n4Vmax · g\r\n2 − 8Vmax · g + 4Vmax g ∈ [0.5, 1]\r\nAn important component of the model is the oculomotor range\r\n(OMR) (Figure 2d), which limits rotation of the eyes such that\r\nthey don’t roll back into the head. The human OMR has been\r\nestimated to be between 45◦\r\nand 55◦\r\n. A virtual character’s\r\nbaseline OMR can be determined based on the size of the\r\neye cavities and the size of its pupils and irises. However,\r\nmerely encoding these OMR values as static parameters is\r\nnot sufficient, as the effective OMR may fluctuate during the\r\ncourse of a single gaze shift. The fluctuation is a product of\r\nthe neural (as opposed to mechanical) nature of the limitation\r\nimposed on eye motion. The virtual agent’s eye rotations are\r\nnever allowed to surpass the current effective OMR.\r\nAt the onset of a gaze shift, effective OMR is computed based\r\non the initial eye position and the baseline OMR. Initial eye\r\n\r\nposition is measured in degrees as a rotational offset of the cur-\r\nrent eye orientation from a central (in-head) orientation. This\r\n\r\nvalue is only non-zero when the rotational offset is contralat-\r\neral (on the opposite side of center) to the target. When the\r\n\r\neyes begin the gaze shift at these angles, the effective OMR\r\nhas a value close to the original baseline value. When the\r\neyes begin the gaze shift closer to a central orientation in the\r\nhead, the effective OMR diminishes [11]. Effective OMR\r\nis also updated throughout the gaze shift at every time step\r\naccording to the concurrent head velocity. As the head moves\r\nfaster, the effective OMR diminishes [20]. See the online\r\nsupplement for details on the effective OMR computations,\r\nincluding equations and empirically derived constants.\r\nThe next component of the model is a user-defined parameter\r\n\r\nspecifying the head alignment preferences of the agent (Fig-\r\nure 2e). Head alignment—how much individuals use their\r\n\r\nheads in performing a gaze shift—is highly idiosyncratic, and\r\ncreates a differential directness of gaze at the target [13]. A\r\nparameter value of 0% for head alignment indicates that once\r\nthe eyes have reached the gaze target, the head stops moving,\r\nresulting in gaze at the target out of the corner of the eyes. On\r\nthe other hand, at a 100% parameter value for head alignment,\r\nthe head continues rotating until it is completely aligned with\r\nthe target, with concomitant compensatory eye movement to\r\nkeep the eyes directed toward the target, resulting in gaze\r\nwith the eyes and head both fully directed towards the target.\r\nHead alignment values between these two extremes can be\r\ncomputed using spherical linear interpolation between the two\r\n\r\ncorresponding rotational values. This parameter can be manip-\r\nulated to create affiliative gaze–keeping high head alignment\r\n\r\nwith a conversational partner and low head alignment with\r\n\r\neverything else–or referential gaze–keeping high head align-\r\nment with information being referred to in the environment\r\n\r\nand low head alignment with the conversational partner. Head\r\nalignment is the most directly controllable input parameter to\r\nthe model, and as such is the parameter we focus on in our\r\nexperimental methodology.\r\nOnce the eyes have reached their target, the vestibulo-ocular\r\nreflex (VOR) keeps them locked to the target while the head\r\n\r\nfinishes its rotation (Figure 2f). This component of gaze,\r\nthe final in our model, is handled by rotating the eyes in the\r\nopposite direction of head motion as the head completes its\r\nportion of the gaze shift, keeping the eyes fixated on the gaze\r\ntarget even as the head keeps rotating.\r\nAncillary components of our model include a blink controller\r\n\r\nfor generating both random and gaze-evoked blinking as de-\r\nscribed by Peters [45], and idle gaze behavior. When the agent\r\n\r\nis not actively engaging in a gaze shift following our model,\r\nthe eyes are controlled by an implementation of the model\r\npresented in Lee et al. [32]. This implementation of subtle\r\n\r\nrandom eye movements has been shown to dramatically in-\r\ncrease the realism of the character. The virtual character’s\r\n\r\neyelids also move with vertical shifts of the eyes, rising up as\r\nthe eyes pitch upwards and dropping down as the eyes pitch\r\ndownward [48]. Lastly, we implemented ambient facial and\r\nbodily cues for our virtual characters to prevent the unnatural\r\nrigidity inherent to a static character. When the character is in\r\nan idle state, these cues include smiles and slight movements\r\nof the arms and the head.\r\nModel Validation\r\n\r\nOur model development was followed by an empirical evalua-\r\ntion of the communicative accuracy and perceived naturalness\r\n\r\nof gaze shifts generated by our model. We compared gaze\r\nshifts generated by our model against those generated by a\r\nbaseline model and those displayed by a human.\r\n\r\nParticipants – Ninety-six participants (50 males and 46 fe-\r\nmales) took part in the validation study. The participants were\r\n\r\nrecruited through Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk online mar-\r\nketplace, following crowd-sourcing best practices to minimize\r\n\r\nthe risk of abuse and to achieve a wide range of demographic\r\nrepresentation [28, 24]. Participants received $2.50.\r\nStudy Design – In the study, participants were shown a series\r\nof videos in which either an animated virtual character or a\r\nhuman confederate shifted gaze toward one of sixteen objects\r\narranged on a desk. This simplified scenario allowed us to\r\nfocus our evaluation on the effectiveness and naturalness of\r\ngaze shifts, while minimizing contextual and interactional\r\nMale Human Confederate Female Human Confederate\r\n\r\nAgent with Male Appearance Agent with Female Appearance\r\nFigure 3.

Participants observed the agent from the\r\nperspective of a collaborator seated across from the agent\r\nor the human confederate. The objects on the desk were\r\nseparated into four groups, distinguished by color and shape.\r\nStill images from the videos are shown in Figure 3.\r\nThe study followed a two-by-four split-plot design. The factors\r\nwere gender–participant matched with agent–varying between\r\nparticipants, and model type, varying within participants. The\r\n\r\nmodel type independent variable included gaze shifts gener-\r\nated by a baseline gaze model from Peters [45], and those\r\n\r\nproduced by our model. The model type independent vari-\r\nable also included two control conditions. In the first control\r\n\r\ncondition, a virtual agent with a male or female appearance\r\n\r\nmaintained gaze toward the participant (i.e., the camera) with-\r\nout producing any gaze shifts at all. In the second control\r\n\r\ncondition, a male or female human confederate presented gaze\r\n\r\nshifts toward the object on a desk in front of him/her. The or-\r\nder in which the conditions were presented to each participant\r\n\r\nwas counterbalanced.\r\nProcedure – Each participant was shown 32 videos of a virtual\r\n\r\ncharacter or human. In the videos, the agents or the confeder-\r\nates gazed toward the participant (i.e., the camera), announced\r\n\r\nthat they are about to look toward an object of a specific color\r\non the table, shifted their gaze toward the object, and moved\r\ntheir gaze back toward the participant. Following each video,\r\nthe participants answered a set of questions that measured the\r\ndependent variables. Participants evaluated each condition\r\nfour times in a stratified order. Each video was approximately\r\n10 seconds, with the overall study lasting around 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nMeasures – The validation study used two dependent vari-\r\nables: communicative accuracy and perceived naturalness.\r\n\r\nCommunicative accuracy was measured by capturing whether\r\nparticipants correctly identified the object toward which the\r\ngaze shift of the agent was directed. Perceived naturalness\r\n\r\nwas measured with a four-item scale with high reliability, in-\r\ncluding naturalness, humanlikeness, lifelikeness, and realism,\r\n\r\nCronbach’s α = .94.\r\nResults – We conducted a mixed-model analysis of variance\r\n(ANOVA) on the data to determine the effect that different\r\n\r\nCommunicative Accuracy\r\nAgent Human Our\r\nModel\r\nBaseline\r\nModel\r\np = ns\r\np = ns\r\n\r\n10%\r\n0%\r\n20%\r\n30%\r\n40%\r\n50%\r\n60%\r\n70%\r\n80%\r\n90%\r\n100%\r\n\r\nPerceived Naturalness\r\n\r\np = .068†\r\n\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n\r\nRealism\r\n\r\np = .017*\r\n\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n\r\nControl\r\n\r\nAgent Human Our\r\nModel\r\nBaseline\r\nModel Control\r\n\r\nAgent Human Our\r\nModel\r\nBaseline\r\nModel Control\r\nFigure 4. Results from the communicative accuracy, perceived naturalness,\r\nand realism measures. Conditions are from left-to-right: agent control (no\r\ngaze shifts, only idle gaze), human control (video of a gazing human), agents\r\nshifting their gaze using a previously published baseline gaze model [45], and\r\nagents shifting their gaze using our model of gaze.\r\n\r\ngaze models had on how accurately participants identified the\r\n\r\nobject that the agents or the human confederates looked to-\r\nward and the perceived naturalness of the gaze shifts. Overall,\r\n\r\nmodel type had a significant effect on communicative accuracy,\r\nF(7, 46.67) = 16.77, p < .001, and perceived naturalness,\r\nF(7, 46.67) = 151.03, p < .001.\r\nPairwise comparisons found no significant differences in\r\nthe communicative accuracy of the gaze shifts produced\r\nby our model and those produced by human confederates,\r\n\r\nF(1, 14.91) = 0.03, p = ns. Similarly, no differences in ac-\r\ncuracy were found between our model and the baseline model,\r\n\r\nF(1, 1958) = 0.17, p = ns. The results suggest that the gaze\r\nshifts generated by our model are just as accurate as those\r\nperformed by human confederates and those generated by the\r\nbaseline model.\r\nComparisons across conditions showed that participants rated\r\ngaze shifts generated by our model as marginally more natural\r\nthan those generated by the baseline model, F(1, 1967) =\r\n3.34, p = .068. Comparisons over realism (one of the items\r\nincluded in the perceived naturalness scale) found that gaze\r\nshifts produced by our model were rated as significantly\r\nmore realistic than those generated by the baseline model,\r\n\r\nF(1, 1963) = 5.75, p = .017. Results on the communica-\r\ntive accuracy, perceived naturalness, and realism measures are\r\n\r\nillustrated in Figure 4.\r\nEXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\r\nThe validated model of gaze shifts provides parameters that\r\n\r\nallow us to explore how manipulation of these low-level param-\r\neters can achieve valuable high-level effects. The main study\r\n\r\nof this paper explores manipulating the head alignment param-\r\neter in order to create more affiliative or more referential gaze\r\n\r\ncues, with the goal of increasing feelings of connection with\r\nthe agent and increasing learning respectively. The experiment\r\nwas carried out in the context of an educational scenario, with\r\nthe virtual agent serving as a lecturer to the human participant.\r\nThe virtual agent taught the participant about a specific subject\r\nfrom ancient Chinese history. A map of China was used as\r\n\r\na reference to facilitate the descriptions of geographical loca-\r\ntions. An example of the interface presented to participants is\r\n\r\nshown in Figure 1.\r\nHypotheses\r\nWe designed an experiment to test three hypotheses. First, we\r\nwished to merely confirm that the presence of an agent will\r\nelicit better learning than only audio.\r\nHypothesis 1 – The presence of an embodied agent will result\r\nin better recall performance than only hearing audio with no\r\naccompanying agent.\r\nThe literature strongly supports the first hypothesis, in which\r\nit is shown that teachers who gaze at their students lead the\r\nstudents to learn better [41, 47]. We seek to show these same\r\neffects can be achieved by virtual agents using our gaze model.\r\nHypothesis 2 – An agent which employs more affiliative gaze\r\n(maintains higher head alignment with the participant) will\r\ngarner higher subjective evaluations than one which uses more\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 709\r\n\r\nStorytelling\r\n\r\nMap\r\n\r\nBoth\r\nReferential\r\nAliative\r\n\r\nHuman\r\n(Participant)\r\nVirtual Space Physical Space\r\n\r\nVirtual Agent\r\n\r\nHu\r\n\r\nBoth\r\nReferentia\r\nl Space\r\n\r\nFigure 5. A diagram of the setup of the study showing the range of the agent’s\r\nhead movements for each gaze condition. The agent’s eye motions (not\r\ndepicted) always move the full distance from eye contact with the participant\r\nto eye contact with each map location being referred to.\r\nreferential gaze (maintains higher head alignment with the\r\ninformation being referred to).\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis is supported by the fact that people are per-\r\nceived as being more intelligent, more trustworthy, and more\r\n\r\nfriendly if they make more direct eye contact [1, 14]. We wish\r\nto extend this work to show that head alignment makes an\r\nimpact on the positive subjective effects of mutual gaze, and\r\nthat our model is capable of achieving these effects.\r\nHypothesis 3 – Viewing an agent using more referential gaze\r\nshould result in better recall performance. This will especially\r\nbe true when the information to be recalled relies on building\r\nassociations to objects in the environment.\r\nReferential gaze helps build associations between information\r\nand objects in the environment. In communication between\r\na human and virtual agent with a shared environment, being\r\nable to perceive the agent’s eye gaze to different objects in\r\nthe environment reduces the time and verbal communication\r\nneeded for grounding references [34]. We believe that head\r\nalignment has the ability to strengthen or weaken this effect\r\nsince it plays a substantial role in shifting a viewer’s visual\r\nattention [23]. When the agent’s head is aligned more fully\r\nwith the object under consideration, this should serve as a\r\nstronger referential gaze cue than if the head is not aligned.\r\nWe wish to show that our gaze model can achieve this effect.\r\nParticipants\r\nWe recruited 20 participants for our study (10 males and\r\n10 females), with ages ranging from 19 to 65 (M = 27.8,\r\nSD = 14.3). Fifteen participants were students and five were\r\nworking members of the community. All were native English\r\n\r\nspeakers. Student participants came from a number of differ-\r\nent fields, including psychology, engineering, and business.\r\n\r\nAll participants were recruited using a combination of campus\r\nflyers and on-line student job forums.\r\nStudy Design\r\nWe employed a within-subjects design for this study. Our\r\nexperiment involved one factor, type of gaze, with four levels,\r\neach of which is defined as follows:\r\n• Audio: The agent is shown briefly during its introduction. Then\r\nthe lights in the virtual scene are extinguished for the duration of\r\nthe lecture, except for a spotlight on the map, so only the map\r\n\r\ncan be seen and the agent is in complete darkness. At the end of\r\nthe lecture, the scene lights turn back on for the agent to give its\r\ninstructions to the participant on taking the subjective evaluation\r\nand quiz for the lecture.\r\n• Affiliative: The agent keeps its head aligned with the participant\r\nas much as possible during the lecture. When the agent is making\r\ndirect eye contact with the participant, the head is fully aligned\r\nwith the participant. When the agent shifts its eye gaze to refer to\r\nsomething on the map, the head aligns as little as possible with the\r\nmap – as much as the agent’s OMR will allow – so as to keep the\r\nhead aligned towards the participant.\r\n• Referential: The agent keeps its head aligned with the map as\r\nmuch as possible during the lecture. When the agent is gazing\r\nat the map, the head is fully aligned with the map. When the\r\nagent shifts its eye gaze back to the participant, the head aligns\r\nas little as possible with the participant – as much as the agent’s\r\nOMR will allow – so as to keep the head aligned towards the\r\nmap. The referential condition is “more referential” (borrowing\r\nthe term “referential” from linguistics) because the head maintains\r\nalignment with the information being referred to on the map, both\r\nwhen looking at the participant (out of the corner of the eyes) and\r\nwhen looking at the map (head and eyes fully aligned).\r\n• Both: When gazing at the participant, the agent keeps its head\r\nfully aligned to the participant. When gazing at the map, the agent\r\naligns its head fully with the map.\r\nFigure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the difference in head motion\r\nbetween the three conditions affiliative, referential, and both.\r\nIt should be stressed that in all three of these conditions, the\r\nagent’s eyes move the full distance from eye contact with the\r\nparticipant to each map location being referred to. The agent’s\r\neyes always converged on each map location while it was\r\nbeing referred to.\r\nEach participant viewed four lectures given by four different\r\nvirtual agents, each utilizing a different gaze condition. Thus,\r\nevery participant was exposed to all four gaze conditions. All\r\nagents, three of which can be seen in Figures 1 and 6, were\r\nspecifically designed to look and sound androgynous so as\r\nto eliminate gender biases as much as possible. Each agent\r\nalways gave the same lecture, but pairings between agent and\r\ngaze condition were stratified across participants for balance.\r\nMap Participant\r\n\r\nReferential/Both Map Referential Participant\r\nA B\r\n\r\nC D\r\n\r\nFigure 6.

The physical setup of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe order in which the lectures – and accordingly gaze con-\r\nditions – were presented to the participants was completely\r\n\r\nrandomized to offset any bias due to fatigue. Lectures were\r\nalso kept informationally distinct in an attempt to decrease\r\nlearning bias. Each lecture was carefully controlled to be near\r\nthe same length–approximately three minutes.\r\nDuring each lecture, the agent makes eleven gaze shifts to\r\nthe map, each followed shortly by a gaze shift back to the\r\nparticipant. The agent fixates its gaze on different targets on\r\nthe map as they are mentioned, e.g. while giving facts about a\r\nChinese city visible on the map. Timing of this gaze shift is\r\ndone according to Griffin [19] and Meyer et al. [38], which\r\nindicate that a deictic gaze shift should occur 800 - 1000 ms\r\nbefore the object being gazed at is mentioned in speech.\r\nImplementation – The experiment was implemented using\r\na custom framework built on top of the Unity game engine\r\n(www.unity3d.com). The gaze model was implemented as\r\n\r\na Unity script. The characters were created using a com-\r\nmercially available parametric base figure. Audio was pre-\r\nrecorded and pitch-shifted to sound androgynous.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\nThe experiment was conducted in a closed study room with\r\nno outside distraction. Participants entered the experiment\r\nroom and were asked to sit at a table with a single computer\r\nmonitor and mouse. The monitor was a 32-inch flat panel\r\ndisplay, allowing the virtual agent representation (only head\r\nand shoulders) to be near life size. This setup can be seen in\r\n\r\nFigure 7. The experimenter gave the participant a brief de-\r\nscription of what they would be asked to do in the experiment,\r\n\r\nand then asked them to review and sign a consent form. The\r\nexperimenter told the participants that they were going to be\r\nlistening to and quizzed on four short lectures from different\r\nvirtual lecturers, each on a topic pertaining to ancient China.\r\nAfter consenting, the experimenter told participants that they\r\ncould press the start button on the screen after he left the room.\r\nUpon pressing the start button, the first lecturer (randomly\r\nchosen by the software) began introducing itself and giving its\r\nlecture. Upon completion of the lecture the screen went black,\r\nand participants filled out on paper a subjective evaluation of\r\n\r\nthe lecturer they had just viewed, followed by a quiz on the ma-\r\nterial presented in the lecture. During the initial instructions,\r\n\r\nthe experimenter made it clear that the quiz was to be filled\r\n\r\nout after the subjective evaluation had been completed. This\r\nallows the subjective evaluation to double as distractor task,\r\nstrengthening any subsequent recall measures. All participants\r\nwere monitored via closed-circuit camera by the experimenter\r\n\r\nto ensure that these instructions were followed, but no partici-\r\npants were observed to neglect the instructions.\r\n\r\nAfter filling out the subjective evaluation and quiz, the par-\r\nticipant could go back to the monitor and click the on-screen\r\n\r\nbutton to begin the next lecture. This process was repeated\r\nuntil all four lectures had been viewed, rated, and quizzed.\r\nAt this point, the experimenter re-entered the room with a\r\nshort questionnaire of demographic information. Following\r\ncompletion of the questionnaire, the experimenter debriefed\r\n\r\nand payed the participant. The total experiment took approxi-\r\nmately 30 minutes, and participants were paid $5.\r\n\r\nMeasures\r\n\r\nOur experiment involved one independent manipulated vari-\r\nable, type of gaze, manipulated within participants. The depen-\r\ndent variables included objective measurements for evaluating\r\n\r\nparticipants’ recall of the lecture material and subjective mea-\r\nsurements for evaluating the participants’ impressions of the\r\n\r\nvirtual agent.\r\nThe objective measurement of recall involved quizzes taken\r\nby all participants following each lecture. Each quiz had\r\nten short-answer questions. These questions were split into\r\n\r\nthree categories (not visible to the participant). One cate-\r\ngory included three questions that asked about information\r\n\r\nnot directly associated with information on the map. Thus,\r\nreferential gaze should not have had an effect on the recall\r\nof this information. An example question in this category\r\nwould be, “In what year did the Jin dynasty overtake control\r\nof China?” The Jin dynasty was not represented on the map\r\nduring the associated lecture. The second category, consisting\r\nof four questions, asked about purely spatial information. For\r\n\r\nexample, one question here was “Which of the Three King-\r\ndoms dynasties extended farthest south?” This question is only\r\n\r\nanswerable by having studied the map. The third category,\r\nincluding the remaining three questions of the quiz, relied\r\non building associations between verbal lecture content and\r\nspatial map locations. For example, “Give one reason why\r\nEmperor Wen declared the city of Luoyang to be his capital\r\n\r\ncity.” Referential gaze was expected to make the biggest im-\r\npact on questions from the latter two categories. Questions\r\n\r\nfrom all three categories were randomly permutated to create\r\nthe final ten-question quiz.\r\n\r\nThe subjective measurements were split into six broad indica-\r\ntors. Each question within the indicators took the form of a\r\n\r\nseven-point rating scale. Item reliability (Cronbach’s α) was\r\nacceptable or better for all except skilled communicator.\r\n1. Likeability: Four-item measure of how likeable the participant\r\nfound the agent to be. Includes questions on perceived friendliness\r\nand helpfulness. (Cronbach’s α = .78)\r\n\r\n2. Rapport: Six-item measure of how much the participant felt feel-\r\nings of rapport in relation to the agent. Questions asked, e.g., how\r\n\r\nwell the participant felt he or she connected with the agent and\r\nhow willingly he or she would disclose personal information to\r\nthe virtual agent following the lecture. (Cronbach’s α = .84)\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 711\r\n\r\nFigure 9. Objective measure (recall measured by post-lecture quiz). On\r\nthe left is the total quiz performance, on the right is the quiz performance\r\nwhen only considering a subset of the questions: those dealing with spatial\r\ninformation and building associations.\r\n\r\n3.

Intelligence: Three-item measure of how intelligent the participant\r\nperceived the agent to be. Includes ratings of competence and\r\nexpertise. (Cronbach’s α = .84)\r\n5. Skilled Communicator: Three-item measure of how effective at\r\nconveying lecture material the participant perceived the agent to\r\nbe. Item reliability was questionable (Cronbach’s α = .62)\r\n6. Engagement: Six-item measure of how engaged the participant felt\r\nduring the lecture. Includes personal ratings of focus, attentiveness,\r\nand satisfaction. (Cronbach’s α = .89)\r\nManipulation Checks\r\nTo check that our gaze type manipulations were being noticed\r\nbetween the visible agent conditions, we asked the participants\r\nto rate from 0% to 100% how much they felt the agent was\r\npaying attention to them and to the map. We expected that\r\nparticipants would feel more attended to in the affiliative and\r\nboth conditions than in the referential condition. Conversely,\r\nwe expected participants to feel like the agent was attending\r\nto the map more in the referential and both gaze conditions\r\nthan in the affiliative condition.\r\nResults\r\nAnalysis of our data was conducted using a repeated measures\r\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA). We used Tukey-Kramer HSD\r\n\r\nto control the experiment-wise error rate in all post-hoc tests.\r\nOur analysis started with the manipulation check. We found\r\n\r\nthat participants felt more attended to in the affiliative gaze con-\r\ndition versus the referential condition, F(1, 69) = 12.53, p <\r\n\r\n.001. They also felt more attended to in the both condition\r\n\r\nversus referential, F(1, 69) = 4.37, p = .040. Finally, par-\r\nticipants felt that the agent attended to the map more in the\r\n\r\nreferential condition versus affiliative, F(1, 69) = 7.75, p =\r\n.007. This difference was not found to be significant for the\r\nboth condition versus affiliative, F(1, 69) = 0.37, p = .55,\r\nhowever participants rated the agent as attending more to\r\nthe map in the referential condition over the both condition,\r\nF(1, 69) = 4.75, p = .033.\r\nNext we analyzed the objective results in the form of recall\r\n\r\nquiz scores (Figure 9). In terms of overall score, the au-\r\ndio condition resulted in significantly lower recall than the\r\n\r\nother three visible agent conditions, including affiliative gaze,\r\nF(1, 69) = 19.38, p < .001, referential gaze, F(1, 69) =\r\n37.78, p < .001, and both, F = 31.91, p < .001. When\r\nconsidering only the seven (out of ten total) questions that\r\n\r\ndealt with purely spatial map information and building asso-\r\nciations between verbal lecture content and locations on the\r\n\r\nmap, we found that the referential gaze condition resulted in\r\nsignificantly better recall performance than the affiliative gaze\r\ncondition, F(1, 69) = 5.62, p = .021. The increase in recall\r\nperformance from the both condition over affiliative does not\r\n\r\nquite reach significance, F(1, 69) = 2.58, p = .11. Refer-\r\nential and both were not significantly different, F(1, 69) =\r\n\r\n0.59, p = .45.\r\n\r\nFinally, we analyzed the subjective measures. Here we ob-\r\nserved that on the likeability scale, the referential condition\r\n\r\nrated lower than both the affiliative condition, F(1, 69) =\r\n58.86, p < .001, and both condition, F(1, 69) = 52.65, p <\r\n.001. On the rapport scale, the referential condition also rated\r\nlower than both affiliative, F(1, 69) = 13.25, p < .001, and\r\nboth, F(1, 69) = 7.95, p = .006. The trust scale had similar\r\nresults, with the referential condition rated lower than both\r\naffiliative, F(1, 69) = 8.63, p = .005, and both, F(1, 69) =\r\n\r\n5.55, p = .021. The intelligence scale again shows the referen-\r\ntial condition getting rated lower than affiliative, F(1, 69) =\r\n\r\n11.38, p = .001, and both, F(1, 69) = 10.99, p = .002. The\r\n\r\nskilled communicator scale yielded no significant results be-\r\nFigure 8. Results for subjective evaluations (likeability, rapport, trust, intelligence, skilled communicator, and engagement) based on gaze condition.\r\n\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 712\r\n\r\ntween conditions, but the engagement scale showed the ref-\r\nerential condition getting rated significantly lower than the\r\n\r\naffiliative condition, F(1, 69) = 14.53, p < .001, and both\r\ncondition, F(1, 69) = 17.16, p < .001. These results are\r\nsummarized in Figure 8.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe purpose of the experiment was to demonstrate how subtle\r\n\r\nchanges in gaze behavior can lead to significant high-level ef-\r\nfects, with the goal of improving learning and positive feelings\r\n\r\nof affiliation. To do this, we manipulated the head align-\r\nment parameter in our model implemented on various virtual\r\n\r\nlecturing agents. We showed that by manipulating just this\r\n\r\nparameter for a virtual agent shifting its gaze from the partici-\r\npant to an object in the scene (i.e., the map of China) and back\r\n\r\nagain, the agent could achieve very different subjective and\r\nobjective effects, including the participant’s feelings toward\r\nthe agent and information recall respectively.\r\nConfirming our first hypothesis, the mere presence of an agent\r\nresulted in better recall performance than audio alone, no\r\nmatter which gaze condition was being used. For five out of\r\nsix subjective scales, the affiliative and both gaze conditions\r\nachieved better ratings than the referential condition. This\r\nleads us to accept our second hypothesis, showing that human\r\nlisteners prefer when the virtual agent speaker aligns its head\r\nfully with the participant while speaking, rather than looking\r\nout of the corners of its eyes with its head aligned towards\r\n\r\nsomething else. The skilled communicator scale did not ex-\r\nhibit this effect, which could mean that participants thought\r\n\r\nthe agent was doing a similarly decent job of communicating\r\nthe lecture content no matter which gaze condition was used.\r\nWe also have strong support for our third hypothesis, where\r\nwe showed that referential gaze results in better participant\r\nrecall than affiliative gaze. By keeping its head aligned with\r\n\r\nthe map as much as possible, the agent compelled the partic-\r\nipant to concentrate more on the map and learn the spatial\r\n\r\nlocations better, while building associations between verbal\r\nlecture content and those same locations. As a reminder, the\r\n\r\nsame amount of gaze was used by the agent in both the affilia-\r\ntive and referential gaze conditions. Hence in both conditions\r\n\r\nthe participant was able to benefit from gaze as an arousal\r\nstimulus to learn the lecture material better. The difference\r\nlies in the way each gaze shift was performed, proving that\r\n\r\nnot all ways of gazing are equal and subtle changes can cre-\r\nate significant outcomes. Overall, this study showed that our\r\n\r\nmodel was capable of achieving targeted outcomes.\r\nDesign Implications\r\n\r\nEmbodied agents’ potential in computer interfaces is increas-\r\ning with the ever-growing popularity of interactive games and\r\n\r\ncomputer-based tools for learning, motivation, and rehabilita-\r\ntion. However, agent designers need controllable models of\r\n\r\ninteractive behavior and evidence that these models effectively\r\nimprove outcomes such as learning and rapport. Our work\r\nprovides one such example in the context of gaze.\r\nWe have shown that it is possible to implement in virtual\r\nagents the very subtle gaze cues that humans use to great\r\neffect in social situations, and that manipulating these cues\r\ncan achieve significant objective and subjective high-level\r\n\r\neffects in a human interacting with the agent. Designers of\r\nvirtual agents can use these subtle gaze behaviors, such as head\r\nalignment, to reach different desired outcomes. If the agent\r\ndesigner wants human interlocutors to pay more attention to\r\nspecific objects in the environment, possibly to learn more\r\nabout them, the agent could be programmed to use high head\r\nalignment when gazing to those objects. Similarly, if the agent\r\ndesigner wants the agent to build a stronger relationship with\r\nthe human interlocutor, increasing feelings of, e.g., rapport\r\nand trust, the agent should be programmed to use high head\r\nalignment when gazing towards the human. Our model of\r\ngaze behavior offers a simple and effective means to control\r\nthe low-level gaze parameters found in physiological research.\r\nVirtual agent designers can use and build off of this model\r\nto create rich, compelling gaze behaviors that accomplish the\r\nhigh-level effects they wish to achieve.\r\nLimitations and Future Work\r\n\r\nOur gaze mechanisms are currently focused on the contribu-\r\ntions of the head and eyes alone. Future extensions should\r\n\r\nconsider the movement of other body parts, such as employing\r\n\r\nthe neck in performing head movements. While the work pre-\r\nsented here explored our gaze shift model on very humanlike\r\n\r\ncharacters, we intend to explore its application to different\r\ncharacter designs, e.g., stylized cartoons, and embodiments,\r\ne.g., storytelling robots [39]. We also intend to run future\r\nstudies exercising different parameters of the model (e.g., head\r\n\r\nlatency) and measuring the effects of subtle gaze cues in dif-\r\nferent interaction modalities, such as VR and mobile devices.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nGaze is a complex and powerful cue. Through subtle changes\r\n\r\nin gaze, people can achieve a wide range of social and com-\r\nmunicative goals, affecting their partner of interaction in a\r\n\r\nvariety of different ways. Gaze cues, as with all embodied\r\ncommunication cues, hold a strong fundamental connection\r\nwith key social, cognitive, and task outcomes. This connection\r\nreveals an opportunity for designing embodied dialog with\r\nvirtual agents. Designing gaze behaviors for virtual agents\r\nthat can achieve specifically targeted high-level outcomes has\r\nlong been a difficult problem. By creating a mechanism for\r\n\r\nsynthesizing gaze shifts in a natural, yet parameterized fash-\r\nion, we have provided a building block for creating high-level\r\n\r\nsocial and communicative behaviors. In this paper we pre-\r\nsented a model of gaze shifts validated to achieve humanlike\r\n\r\ngaze for virtual agents, and a study which shows that it can\r\nachieve interesting subjective and objective effects through\r\nmanipulation of low-level gaze parameters. These subtle gaze\r\ncues are effective in the context of our gaze model due to\r\nthe grounded physiological approach we took in designing it.\r\nBy manipulating and combining them in different ways, we\r\nbelieve that virtual agents will soon have access to a rich new\r\nsource of possible gaze behaviors, resulting in human-agent\r\ninteractions that are more effective and rewarding.\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nThis research was supported by National Science Founda-\r\ntion award 1017952.

How does this affect\r\n\r\nfuture interface designers? We replicated classical tests of\r\nsocial influence known as the social facilitation and\r\ninhibition effects. Social facilitation/inhibition theory states\r\nthat when in the presence of others, people perform simple\r\ntasks better and complex tasks worse. Participants were\r\nrandomly assigned to perform both simple and complex\r\ntasks alone and in the presence of either a real human, a\r\n\r\nprojected virtual human, or a virtual human in a head-\r\nmounted display. Our results showed participants were\r\n\r\ninhibited by the presence of others, whether real or virtual.\r\nThat is, participants performed worse on the complex task,\r\nboth in terms of percent correct and reaction times, when in\r\nthe presence of others than when alone.

[Information Interfaces and Presentation]: Multimedia\r\nInformation Systems - Artificial, augmented, and virtual\r\nrealities, Evaluation/methodology; H.5.2 User Interfaces -\r\nEvaluation/methodology; J.4 [Social and Behavioral\r\nSciences]: Psychology.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nVirtual humans, also referred to as interface agents, act as a\r\nnew medium to interact with system information. Maes [15]\r\ndescribes interface agents as:\r\n“Instead of user-initiated interaction via commands\r\n\r\nand/or direct manipulation, the user is engaged in a co-\r\noperative process in which human and computer agents\r\n\r\nboth initiate communication, monitor events and\r\nperform tasks. The metaphor used is that of a personal\r\nassistant who is collaborating with the user in the same\r\nwork environment.”\r\nWith the emergence of interface agents [16] and virtual\r\ncharacters in everyday applications, understanding how\r\npeople respond to interface agents is crucial. One way to\r\nexamine peoples’ responses to agents and avatars in a social\r\nsetting is to look at social psychology literature.\r\nIn social psychology literature, one of the classical tests that\r\nshow how the presence of others affects task performance is\r\nsocial facilitation/inhibition [29, 6, 25]. Social\r\nfacilitation/inhibition refers to performance enhancement of\r\na simple or well learned task, and performance impairment\r\nof a complex or novel task, when completed in the presence\r\nof others. Zajonc suggests that this phenomenon is due to\r\nthe facilitation of dominant responses that occurs under\r\nincreased physiological arousal [29]. When a person\r\nperforms a task in the presence of an audience,\r\nphysiological arousal occurs, facilitating whatever happens\r\n\r\nto be their dominant response. When a task is easy or well-\r\nlearned (e.g., simple math problems, such as “Is 2 + 2 =\r\n\r\n4?”), the dominant response to the task is likely to be the\r\ncorrect response, thus the presence of others facilitates\r\nperformance on these tasks. Conversely, when a task is\r\nnovel or difficult (e.g., complex math problems), the correct\r\nresponse is typically not the dominant response; therefore\r\nan increased dominant response will impair, rather than\r\nfacilitate performance on these tasks. Although most social\r\npsychologists are in agreement that social\r\nfacilitation/inhibition effects are due to the increased\r\narousal that occurs in the presence of an audience, much\r\ndebate has ensued over the specific cause of this arousal.\r\nSome researchers suggest that these effects result from the\r\n\r\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\r\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\r\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies\r\nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Whereas, Zajonc maintains that the mere\r\npresence of others (even in the absence of evaluation) is\r\nenough to create physiological arousal [29]; he suggests\r\nthat this response stems from evolutionarily adaptive\r\ntendencies to remain vigilant and alert in the presence of\r\nothers. Others suggest that this phenomenon is simply due\r\nto the fact that an audience distracts attention from the task\r\nat hand [2]. In support of this, researchers have found\r\nsimilar facilitation and inhibition effects to occur in\r\nresponse to “nonsocial” distractions, such as loud bursts of\r\nnoise or lights.\r\nThe present study examines if this theory from social\r\npsychology carries over to interacting with virtual humans\r\nor agents in the context of social facilitation/inhibition.\r\nDirectly comparing the results of human-human interaction\r\nwith human-virtual human interaction may result in a better\r\nunderstanding of social responses to virtual human\r\ninterfaces and lead to improved interface design.\r\nRELATED WORK\r\nSocial Facilitation and Inhibition\r\nTriplett’s first investigation of social influence in 1898 led\r\nto the development of many social facilitation theories and\r\nstudies [25]. These social facilitation theories include\r\nZajonc’s drive theory [29], Cottrell, Wack, Sekerak, and\r\nRittle’s socialization theory [8], and Sanders, Baron and\r\nMoore’s [22] attentional conflict theory. Numerous studies\r\nhave been conducted to test the effect of the presence of\r\nothers on task performance; Bond and Titus performed a\r\nmeta-analysis of 241 social facilitation studies and\r\nsummarized the results of these studies [6].\r\nIn a more recent study, Blascovich et al. conducted an\r\nexperiment on social facilitation based on the\r\nbiopsychosocial model of challenge and threat [5]. This\r\nmodel states that in goal-relevant situations involving\r\naffective and cognitive processes, challenge occurs when\r\nthe resources from individual experiences meet demands of\r\nthe situation, whereas for threat, these resources are\r\ninsufficient to meet demands. In the experiment, the authors\r\nmeasured cardiovascular responses of participants while\r\nthey either performed a novel or well-learned task alone or\r\nin the presence of others. They found that participants\r\nperforming the well-learned task in the presence of others\r\nhad an increased cardiac response and decreased vascular\r\nresistance, whereas participants performing a novel-learned\r\ntask in the presence of others had an increased cardiac\r\nresponse and increased vascular resistance. Both of which\r\nfit the challenge and threat model. Participants performing\r\nthe task alone, learned or unlearned, demonstrated no\r\nappreciable reactivity from baseline.\r\nHoyt et al. assessed the utility of using immersive virtual\r\nenvironment technology for social psychological research\r\n[12]. Participants mastered one of two tasks and\r\nsubsequently performed the mastered or non-mastered task\r\n\r\neither alone or in the presence of a virtual human audience\r\n\r\nwhom they were led to believe were either computer-\r\ncontrolled agents or human-controlled avatars. The authors\r\n\r\nfound that participants performing in the presence of\r\navatars demonstrated classic social inhibition performance\r\nimpairment effects relative to those performing alone or in\r\nthe presence of agents. However, this study introduced a\r\npossible confound by having the research assistants\r\nphysically present in the experimental room in the avatar\r\naudience condition. Additionally, the research data did not\r\nstrongly indicate the effect of audience.\r\nRickenberg and Reeves ran an experiment to test the effects\r\nof different animated character presentation on user anxiety,\r\ntask performance, and subjective evaluations of two\r\ncommerce Web sites [21]. They found that the effects of\r\nmonitoring and individual differences in the way a person\r\nthinks about control worked as they do in real life. Users\r\nfelt more anxious when characters monitored their Web site\r\nwork and this effect was strongest for users with an external\r\ncontrol orientation. Monitoring characters also decreased\r\ntask performance, but increased trust in Web site content. In\r\nthe present study, we are interested in directly comparing\r\npeople’s responses to a virtual human with their responses\r\nto a real human. In addition, we are interested in doing this\r\nin the context of social psychology to examine how social\r\ninteractions between people map to social interaction with\r\nvirtual humans.\r\nWe have previously conducted a study which attempted to\r\nreplicate the social facilitation/social inhibition effects [28].\r\nParticipants first learned a task and were then randomly\r\nassigned to perform the same or a novel task either alone, in\r\nthe presence of a real human, or in the presence of a virtual\r\nhuman. Although the results of the study showed that\r\npeople reacted to the virtual human similarly to the way\r\nthey reacted to the real human, our results did not indicate a\r\nstrong effect and we were able to replicate the inhibition\r\neffect with females only. In addition, we found that more\r\nwomen learned the novel task when alone than when being\r\nobserved by either a human or a virtual human. However, it\r\nseemed that male participants were not affected by the\r\npresence of an audience, both in terms of inhibition and\r\nfacilitation. We believe that the weak results from the\r\nprevious study were largely due to the pattern recognition\r\nand number categorization tasks that were used to produce\r\nthe social inhibition and facilitation effects. Student\r\nreactions were variable and a number of participants did not\r\nunderstand the task.\r\nOur current study uses a more well-defined task and a more\r\nsensitive experimental design. We chose a task that varied\r\ndifficulty by using simple and complex math problems. We\r\nhad evidence that verified the difficulty levels of the items\r\nfrom previous studies with the same student population [9].\r\nUsing math problems also eliminates the need for a training\r\nphase where participants are required to learn a task.\r\nEliminating the training phase allowed us to treat audience\r\n\r\n(alone or in the presence of another) as a within subjects\r\nvariable.\r\nInterface Agents\r\nReeves and Nass have shown through several studies that\r\npeople interact, treat, and identify with computers and\r\nsoftware agents based on perceived, human characteristics,\r\nsuch as the computer’s helpfulness, expertise, and\r\nfriendliness [20].\r\nA recent trend in computer interfaces has been to include\r\nagents or avatars in an attempt to enhance the user\r\nexperience. Koda and Maes [14] argue that employing a\r\nface as the representation of an agent is engaging, makes a\r\nuser pay more attention, and takes more effort for a user to\r\ninteract with the system. They also found that realistic faces\r\nwere better liked and rated more intelligent than abstract\r\nfaces by the users.\r\nParise et al., investigated how cooperation with a computer\r\nagent was affected by the agent\'s pictorial realism and\r\nhuman likeness. Participants played a game with a talking\r\ncomputer agent that resembled a person, a real dog, a\r\ncartoon dog, or with a confederate through a video link.\r\nThey found that participants cooperated highly with the\r\nagent resembling a person and the confederate. Although\r\nparticipants loved the dog and dog cartoon agents, they\r\ncooperated significantly less with the dog agents [18].\r\nBaylor et al., investigated the impact of interface agent\r\nappearance (age, gender, “coolness”) on enhancing\r\nundergraduate females’ attitudes toward engineering [4].\r\nThey found that females reported more positive stereotypes\r\nof engineers after interacting with a female agent, but\r\nreported that engineering was more useful and engaging\r\nwhen interacting with a male agent. Age interacted with\r\n“coolness” such that young cool agents were more effective\r\nthan young uncool agents, whereas old uncool agents were\r\nmore effective than old cool agents. In another study,\r\nBaylor investigated the impact of a pedagogical agent’s\r\ngender, realism, and ethnicity on affective and motivational\r\noutcomes [3]. The results suggest a need to consider\r\nindividual differences in learning with social interfaces.\r\nThese studies focus on how the appearance of computer\r\nagents affects cooperation, changing attitudes, and\r\nmotivating users. In the present study, we are interested in\r\nhow the mere presence of such an agent might influence\r\ntask performance. Having an ever-present computer agent,\r\ndespite its appearance, might have some unexpected results\r\non the user’s task performance.\r\nVirtual Humans\r\nVirtual humans have previously been used in the context of\r\nsocial psychology. Slater, et al., conducted studies on the\r\neffects and social ramifications of having avatars in virtual\r\nenvironments [24]. They were able to elicit emotions such\r\nas embarrassment, irritation, and self-awareness in virtual\r\nmeetings; and they found that the presence of avatars was\r\n\r\nimportant for social interaction, task performance, and\r\npresence [24].\r\nIn a previous study, we examined the roles of gender and\r\nvisual realism in the persuasiveness of speakers [26].\r\nParticipants were presented with a persuasive passage\r\ndelivered by a male or female person, virtual human, or\r\nvirtual character. They were then assessed on attitude\r\nchange and their ratings of the argument, message, and\r\nspeaker. The results indicated that the virtual speakers were\r\nas effective at changing attitudes as real people. Male\r\nparticipants were more persuaded when the speaker was\r\nfemale than when the speaker was male, whereas female\r\nparticipants were more persuaded when the speaker was\r\nmale than when the speaker was female. In addition, ratings\r\nof the perceptions of the speaker were more favorable for\r\nvirtual speakers than for human speakers.\r\nVirtual humans are also being used to improve the\r\neffectiveness of an Educational Virtual World (EVW) that\r\nincorporates different presentation techniques in the\r\nPresentation of Education and Training Subjects (PETS)\r\nsystem [7]. The virtual human provides both pedagogical\r\nand navigational assistance, and can be tailored to the needs\r\nand preferences of the learner.\r\nResearchers have even proposed the use of virtual humans\r\nto help children with learning disabilities. In a system\r\nnamed “Buddy”, a virtual child acts as a virtual friend for\r\nautistic children with a hidden eye tracker and camera to\r\ntrain a child’s social attention by reinforcing gaze behavior\r\nand encourages the child to look at the animated face’s\r\ninformative area [19]. Virtual humans have also been used\r\nby medical students to practice patient interviewing skills\r\nusing natural methods of interaction with a high level of\r\nimmersion [13].\r\nIn all of these applications virtual humans are meant to aid\r\nthe user in some way, training, teaching, or even acting as a\r\nfriend. There is an underlying assumption that the virtual\r\nhuman will only have a positive effect on the user. It is\r\ntherefore important to fully understand how people\r\nresponse to virtual humans in these social settings. By\r\nreplicating one of the classical tests of social influence with\r\na virtual human, we hope that the present study will shed\r\nsome light on this subject.\r\nEXPERIMENTAL STUDY\r\nBuilding on the lessons learned from our first experiment\r\nwith social facilitation and inhibition [28], we have\r\ndesigned a follow-up study that uses simple and complex\r\ntasks rather than learned and novel tasks. Simple and\r\ncomplex math tasks were chosen because they eliminated\r\nthe need for a training phase (since we can assume that all\r\ncollege students have some basic math skills); and allowed\r\nus to treat task type as a within-subject rather than a\r\nbetween-subject variable. That is, all participants performed\r\nboth the simple and complex tasks for this experiment. In\r\naddition, we were interested in how the level of immersion\r\n\r\nmight influence the results. We compared participants’\r\nreactions to a real and virtual human and included a fully\r\nimmersive condition using a head mounted display (HMD)\r\nsuch that the user is fully immersed in an environment\r\nwhere the virtual human appears in three dimensions.\r\nSocial facilitation/inhibition theory simply states that\r\npeople perform simple tasks better when in the presence of\r\nothers, and complex tasks worse. For this experiment, we\r\nhypothesized that participants’ reactions to the presence of\r\nthe real and virtual human would show social facilitation\r\nand inhibition effects.\r\nSeveral researchers have shown that using an HMD leads to\r\na significantly higher sense of presence in a virtual\r\nenvironment than non-immersive displays [11, 25]. For\r\ninstance, in an experiment on the fear of public speaking,\r\nSlater et al. found that presence tended to amplify\r\nparticipants’ responses to a virtual audience (which was\r\neither positive or negative) [23]. In other words: People\r\nexperiencing a higher level of presence were prone to report\r\nmore negative reactions to a negative audience and more\r\npositive reactions to a positive audience. Given the\r\nexpected higher sense of presence in the immersive\r\ncondition, we believe that participants will experience\r\nhigher levels of facilitation and inhibition in the fully\r\nimmersive virtual human condition than in the projected\r\nvirtual human condition.\r\nParticipants\r\nA total of 85 students (23 males, 62 females, mean age =\r\n23.7, SD = 8.28) from the University of North Carolina at\r\nCharlotte participated in the study. Volunteers were\r\nrecruited from the psychology department subject pool, and\r\nall received credit points towards their psychology class\r\ngrade.\r\nStimulus Materials\r\nBoth simple and complex tasks required the participants to\r\nverify the accuracy of a series of mathematical equations\r\npresented in sentence form. The simple tasks consisted of\r\naddition or subtraction problems with one operation\r\npresented as a yes or no question, “Is 5 + 2 = 7?” The\r\ncomplex consisted of four operations (addition, subtraction,\r\nmultiplication, and division), such as: Is (2 x 3) + (4 / 1) - 5\r\n= 5? The numbers used were integers between 1 and 10.\r\nFor the incorrect examples (such as Is 7 - 3 = 5? Or Is (6/3)\r\n+ 8 - (4 x 2) = 3), the answer was within two values of the\r\ncorrect answer. Participants were required to verify the\r\naccuracy of the statement by making a key press response.\r\nProportion of items answered correctly and the response\r\ntime were used as measures of task performance.\r\nPre experimental questionnaires collected data on\r\nparticipant characteristics (such as age, gender and\r\nethnicity, computer use) and measured math anxiety. The\r\nmath anxiety scale [1] includes 25 items that measure the\r\nparticipants’ level of anxiety by asking them to rate how\r\nanxious different math-related statements make them feel\r\n\r\n(such as “Studying for a math test” or “Watching a teacher\r\nwork on an algebraic equation on the blackboard”). These\r\nitems are assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (1 - Not at all, 2\r\n– A little, 3 – A fair amount, 4 – Much, 5 – Very Much) and\r\nitem responses are summed into a math anxiety score. The\r\nscore was used for screening to make sure that participants\r\nin all conditions are equivalent in advance of the\r\nexperiment. This measure helped determine if there were\r\nany preexisting confounding factors among the different\r\ngroups.\r\nPost experimental questionnaires measured task anxiety and\r\ncopresence. Task anxiety was measured with one item that\r\nasked the participants to rate their level of anxiety on a 7\r\npoint numerical scale (1. not at all to 7. a great deal).\r\nCopresence refers to the participants’ sense of being with\r\nanother person in the second phase of the experiment. The\r\ncopresence questionnaire was adapted from the Slater\r\nCoPresence Questionnaire [17]. Participants used a 7-point\r\nnumerical scale (1. not at all to 7. a great deal) to respond to\r\nseventeen items (such as “I had a sense of being with the\r\nother person....” or “The experience seems to me more like\r\ninteracting with a person...”). Responses to the items were\r\nused to compute two measures: copresence mean and count.\r\nThe copresence mean is the average rating across all of the\r\nitems and the copresence count indicates the number of\r\nresponses that were higher than four.\r\nApparatus\r\nA Pentium IV 2.4 GHz Dell PC with an nVidia GeForce4\r\nTi 4200 graphics card served as the graphics generator for\r\nthe virtual human. The graphics were rendered with\r\nOpenGL then projected using a Sony VPL-CX5 data\r\nprojector.\r\nStimulus presentation and data collection were controlled\r\nby an additional Pentium IV 2.4 GHz Dell PC attached to a\r\n17 inch flatscreen monitor (Figures 1 and 2).\r\nFor the virtual human immersive condition, the participants\r\nused a head mounted display (HMD) (figure 3a). We used a\r\nVirtual Research V8 HMD which has 640 X 480 resolution\r\nin each eye. The HMD contains two small screens about\r\ntwo inches in front of the eyes. A 3rdTech HiBall-3100\r\nTracker was used to track position and orientation. The\r\nstimuli screen and virtual human were rendered in the same\r\nvirtual room. Figure 3b shows the participant’s view of the\r\nvirtual human from the HMD.\r\nWe used one of Haptek Corporation’s interactive 3-D\r\ncharacters for the virtual human [10]. Haptek also has a\r\nlibrary which allowed us to create our own realistic\r\nanimations and behaviors.\r\nThe nature of this experiment requires that the audience,\r\nboth human and virtual, exhibit only non-verbal gestures\r\nand behaviors. In order to make our virtual human, Diana,\r\n\r\nhuman-like, we modeled her actions based on the non-\r\nverbal behaviors of the human audience in this experiment\r\n\r\nand executed them at random. These behaviors included\r\n\r\ncoughing, sniffling, yawning, looking around, clearing\r\nthroat, and shifting in her chair. In addition, Diana displays\r\nlife-like behaviors such as breathing, blinking, and other\r\nsubtle gestures. Two speakers at the bottom of the\r\nprojection screen were used to output the various sounds\r\nfrom Diana (coughing, sniffing, etc.).\r\n\r\nFigure 1.

Participant view of virtual audience in the Virtual\r\n\r\nHuman Immersive condition\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\nPre-Experiment: In the main area of the lab, participants\r\nfilled out the informed consent form and the pre-experiment\r\nquestionnaire. They were then given instructions regarding\r\nthe experimental procedures.\r\nPractice-Session: The participants were taken to the testing\r\nroom where they were instructed on how to perform the\r\ntasks. Specifically, they were told the objective of the tasks,\r\nshown how to use the keyboard to respond, and led through\r\na sample trial for each task to familiarize them with the\r\nprocedures and the tones following the correct and incorrect\r\nresponses.\r\nPhase I: The first phase of the experiment was the alone\r\ncondition which involved completion of the simple and\r\ncomplex math tasks while alone in the room. Each task\r\nincluded 25 math sentences with an equal number of correct\r\nand incorrect problems randomly arranged. Participants\r\nwere escorted to the experiment room to perform these\r\ntasks and were instructed to return to the main area of the\r\nlab when done. The experimenter left the room. After the\r\nparticipants completed phase I, there was a five minute rest\r\nperiod during which the participants received instructions\r\nspecific to their randomly assigned conditions for phase II.\r\nThose assigned to one of the two virtual human audience\r\ncondition were told that during the task they would be\r\njoined by a computer-controlled virtual observer. Those\r\nassigned to the human audience condition were told that\r\nduring the task they would be joined by a female observer.\r\nPhase II: In the human audience condition, the female\r\nobserver was seated in a chair arranged so that she can\r\nobserve the participant and the projection screen. In the\r\nvirtual human projected condition, our virtual human,\r\nDiana, was projected on a screen so that she too can\r\n‘observe’ the participant and the testing screen. In the\r\nvirtual human immersive condition, Diana was displayed in\r\nthe HMD. She was seated behind a virtual desk. Diana\r\n\r\nlooked at the screen and at the participant. Her nonverbal\r\nresponses were intended to indicate some genuine interest\r\nin what the participant was doing.\r\nPost-Experiment: Upon completion of the testing phase,\r\nparticipants returned to the main area of the lab, where they\r\nfilled out a short questionnaire and were debriefed and\r\nthanked for their participation.\r\nThe experiment took approximately half an hour to\r\ncomplete.\r\nDesign\r\nA 3 x 2 x 2 mixed analysis of variance was used to test for\r\nthe main and interaction effects of each of the variables that\r\nare under study\r\n1. Group (Human, Virtual Human Projected,\r\nVirtual Human Immersive)\r\n2. Task type (Simple vs. Complex)\r\n3. Audience condition (Alone vs. Audience)\r\nThe first variable was manipulated between subjects while\r\nthe others were repeated measures. Participants were\r\nrandomly assigned to one of three groups:\r\n1. Human (H)\r\n2. Virtual Human Projected (VHP)\r\n3. Virtual Human Immersive (VHI)\r\nRESULTS\r\nTask Performance Data\r\nAccuracy and response times were automatically recorded\r\nfor each participant on every trial. Task performance data\r\nwere computed by summing the number of correct\r\nresponses across the 25 trials in each condition and\r\nconverting to percentages. Reaction times measured the\r\ntime from the presentation of the math question until the\r\nparticipant’s response. There was no limit set for response\r\ntime. Reaction times were trimmed such that responses that\r\nwere more than two standard deviations from the mean\r\nwere not included in the analysis; 4.9% of the responses\r\nwere eliminated for this reason. Mean reaction times were\r\ncalculated for the remaining responses that were scored as\r\ncorrect.\r\nThe task performance data were treated with a 3 x 2 x 2\r\nANOVA to test for the between subject effect of group\r\n(Human, Virtual Human Projected, Virtual Human\r\nImmersive), and the within subject effects of task type\r\n(Simple vs. Complex) and audience (Alone vs. Audience).\r\nPercent Correct\r\nTable 1 shows the mean percentages for the simple and\r\ncomplex tasks by audience type and group.\r\nAs expected, there was a significant main effect for task\r\ntype, F(1, 82) = 145.66, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.64. Participants\r\nperformed significantly better on the simple task (M =\r\n94.86%) than on the complex task (M = 83.92%).\r\n\r\nThere was a significant main effect of audience, F(1, 82) =\r\n6.86, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.08. Participants performed\r\nsignificantly better alone (M = 90.22%) than in the presence\r\nof an audience (M = 88.56%).\r\nFigure 4 shows the significant interaction effect of task by\r\naudience, F(1, 82) = 10.46, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.11. Participants\r\nperformed slightly better on the simple task when in the\r\npresence of an audience than alone, and much worse on the\r\ncomplex task when in the presence of an audience than\r\nalone (see Table 1 for means).\r\nThere were no performance differences among the groups\r\n(Human, Virtual Human Projected, Virtual Human\r\nImmersive), F(2, 82) = 1.29, p = 0.28; and the group\r\nvariable was not found to interact with any of the other\r\nvariables of interest. There was no interaction effect of task\r\nx audience x group, F(2, 82) = 2.24, p = 0.11; or an\r\ninteraction of task by group, F < 1; or an interaction of\r\naudience by group, F(2, 82) = 2.13, p = 0.13. The task by\r\naudience effect was not found to vary significantly by\r\ngroup. The differences found in performance are due to the\r\ntype of task (simple or complex) and the type of audience\r\n(alone or in the presence of others).\r\n\r\nFigure 4. Task by audience interaction for percent correct\r\n\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nReaction Time\r\nTable 2 shows the mean reaction times in milliseconds for\r\nthe simple and complex tasks by audience type and group.\r\n\r\nAs expected, there was a significant main effect for task\r\ntype, F(1, 82) = 1388.75, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.94. Participants\r\nresponded significantly faster on the simple task (M = 2226\r\nms) than on the complex task (M = 9851 ms).\r\nThe effect of audience was also significant, F(1, 82) = 3.35,\r\np = 0.04, η2 = 0.05. Participants responded slightly faster\r\nalone (M = 5875 ms) than in the presence of an audience (M\r\n= 6202 ms).\r\nFigure 5 shows the significant interaction effect of task by\r\naudience, F(1, 82) = 8.22, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.09. Participants\r\nresponded slightly faster on the simple task when in the\r\npresence of an audience than alone, and much slower on the\r\ncomplex task when in the presence of an audience than\r\nalone (see Table 2 for means). This result mirrors the result\r\nfor the per cent correct data. Participants not only\r\nperformed worse on the complex task when there was an\r\naudience present, but they also reacted much slower!\r\n\r\nFigure 5. Task by Audience interaction for reaction time data.\r\nThere was no main effect of group (Human, Virtual Human\r\nProjected, Virtual Human Immersive), F(2, 82) = 1.31, p =\r\n0.28.; and group did not interact with any of the other\r\nvariables of interest. There was no interaction effect of task\r\nx audience x group, F < 1; or an interaction effect of task by\r\ngroup, F(2, 82) = 1.16, p = 0.31; or an interaction effect of\r\naudience by group, F(2, 82) = 1.42, p = 0.25. Once again,\r\nthe differences in performance, in terms of reaction time,\r\n\r\nare not due to group; participants reacted in a similar\r\nfashion whether they were watched by a real or virtual\r\nhuman.\r\nSimple\r\nAlone\r\n\r\nSimple\r\nAudience\r\n\r\nComplex\r\nAlone\r\nComplex\r\nAudience\r\nH1 M = 94.20 M = 94.00 M = 86.70 M = 78.80\r\nSD = 5.72 SD = 7.05 SD = 10.86 SD = 12.72\r\nVHP2 M = 95.17 M = 95.86 M = 87.17 M = 82.62\r\nSD = 4.46 SD = 5.71 SD = 10.16 SD = 12.25\r\nVHI3 M = 94.64 M = 94.89 M = 84.00 M = 83.56\r\nSD = 7.39 SD = 5.38 SD = 13.46 SD = 11.14\r\nAll4 M = 94.72 M = 95.01 M = 85.72 M = 82.12\r\nSD = 6.08 SD = 5.89 SD = 11.78 SD = 11.91\r\nTable 1.

The\r\nmain effect of group was not significant, χ\r\n2\r\n(48) =\r\n\r\n45.10, p=0.59.\r\n When asked: “What percentage of the time did you\r\nfeel that you were being watched by another\r\nperson?” The mean response of the participants in\r\nthe human condition was 49.6% (SD = 50.3),\r\n50.9% in the virtual human projected condition\r\n\r\n(SD = 43.5), and 47.1% in the virtual human\r\nimmersive condition (SD = 48.7). The main effect\r\nof group was not significant, F < 1.\r\nThe following comments from the participants during the\r\ndebriefing session illustrate how the participants felt about\r\nthe virtual human, Diana:\r\n “When she coughed I felt like I was taking too\r\nlong, like impatient??”\r\n “I felt like I was inside a video game!”\r\n “Diana made me feel anxious, like I have to get the\r\nproblems done quickly”\r\n “I did not want [Diana] to think I was stupid”\r\n “I went a little faster when she was watching me”\r\n “When I took longer to answer a question, she was\r\ntrying to peek at what I was doing, and she would\r\nclear her throat...”\r\n “She looked very real, I felt like I was being\r\nwatched!”\r\nFinally, we made the following observations:\r\n Several participants commented about Diana\r\nsneezing during the experiment, this was very\r\ninteresting since Diana never sneezed!\r\n Most of the comments were about the noises that\r\nDiana made (e.g. coughing). Participants seemed\r\nto think that the noises made her more realistic.\r\nComputer\r\nUse\r\nMath\r\nAnxiety\r\nTask\r\nAnxiety\r\n\r\nCo-\r\npresence\r\n\r\nH1 M = 5.55 M = 59.40 M = 3.90 M = 2.70\r\nSD = 1.67 SD = 16.54 SD = 1.83 SD = 0.89\r\nVHP2 M = 5.83 M = 66.72 M = 3.32 M = 2.98\r\nSD = 1.26 SD = 19.22 SD = 2.00 SD = 1.10\r\nVHI3 M = 5.75 M = 65.94 M = 4.00 M = 3.12\r\nSD = 1.11 SD = 19.36 SD = 2.12 SD = 1.09\r\nAll4 M = 5.73 M = 64.67 M = 3.75 M = 3.01\r\nSD = 1.29 SD = 18.71 SD = 2.02 SD = 1.04\r\nTable 3: Means and Standard Deviations of Computer Use,\r\nMath Anxiety, Task Anxiety and Co-presence by group.\r\nSample sizes: N1\r\n= 20, N2\r\n= 29, N3\r\n= 36, N4\r\n= 85\r\n\r\nOther Variables\r\nTable 3 shows the means for computer use, math anxiety,\r\ntask anxiety, and copresence by group (Human, Virtual\r\nHuman Projected, Virtual Human Immersive). There were\r\nno significant differences among the groups on any of these\r\nmeasures, Fs < 1.\r\nIn addition, only the math anxiety scores correlated\r\nsignificantly with the percent correct data, p < 0.01. No\r\n\r\nother correlations were found between these variables and\r\nthe task performance data.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis study found that participants were inhibited while\r\nperforming complex math problems when in the presence\r\nof a human, virtual human projected life-size, and a virtual\r\nhuman in an immersive virtual environment. The type of\r\naudience present was not a factor, just that there was an\r\naudience present. The theory of social inhibition carries\r\nover to the virtual human in this study.\r\nBoth percent correct data and reaction time data worked in\r\nparallel in indicating an inhibition effect. Participants not\r\nonly performed worse in terms of percent correct while in\r\nthe presence of others on the complex task, but they also\r\nperformed much slower.\r\nWe were unable to replicate the facilitation effect whereby\r\npeople perform simple tasks better when in the presence of\r\nothers. Most likely because of a ceiling effect with the\r\nsimple math problems, this is a common problem in social\r\nfacilitation research [6]. Although both the percent correct\r\nand reaction time data show trends towards a facilitation\r\neffect, the results were not strong enough to claim a\r\nfacilitation effect.\r\nThe immersive condition was expected to lead the highest\r\nlevel of inhibition because of the heightened feeling of\r\npresence. This was not the case however; we believe that\r\nthis may have been due to a problem with the lack of\r\nperipheral vision in an HMD (60 degrees diagonal field of\r\nview). The nature of the facilitation/inhibition effects are\r\nsuch that you have someone (in your peripheral vision)\r\nwatching over you while performing task. However, in an\r\nHMD, it is possible to block out the view by turning your\r\nhead. Further research is required to investigate whether\r\nthis was due to peripheral vision.\r\nThe results from this study have implications for future\r\ndesigners of interfaces employing a virtual human. It is\r\ncrucial for interface designers to understand how people\r\nrespond and interact with these virtual human interfaces.\r\nThe results from this study show that virtual humans can\r\nindeed inhibit a person while performing a complex task.\r\nThis should be taken into account when considering a\r\nvirtual human interface that is intended to aid or facilitate a\r\nuser in accomplishing a complex or novel task. Designers\r\nmust be careful that the virtual human interface does not\r\ninhibit rather than facilitate the user!\r\nThe results from this study, as well as others [20, 21, 26],\r\nindicate that many of the rules that apply in human-human\r\ninteraction carry over to interacting with interface agents\r\nand computers. Designers should consider human social\r\ninteraction theories in developing interface agents.\r\nLIMITATIONS OF THIS WORK\r\nThe results of this study are limited to the virtual character\r\nemployed in our experiment and may not generalize to\r\n\r\nother types of virtual characters. Further research is needed\r\nthat examine a larger variety of virtual characters.\r\nAnother drawback was the uneven number of male and\r\nfemale participants who were available for the study. More\r\nmale participants are needed to fully examine the gender\r\neffects.\r\nFinally, to achieve more generalizable findings, this study\r\nshould be replicated with a sample that includes more\r\ndiverse groups of people, not just college students.\r\nFUTURE WORK\r\nThere are a number of remaining questions that could be\r\nanswered with further research. One of our future goals is\r\nto examine possible cross gender interactions by adding a\r\nmale observer as well as more male participants.\r\nAnother future goal is to track the head movements of the\r\nparticipants in the HMD condition. We suspect that the\r\nproblem of lack of peripheral vision in an HMD made have\r\ncontributed to the results from that condition. Tracking and\r\nlogging the head movements of the participants will allow\r\nus to visualize and analyze exactly where the participants\r\nwere looking during the experiment. In addition, to increase\r\nparticipants’ peripheral vision, we can use an HMD with a\r\nhigher field of view.\r\nWe are also interested in the effect of the appearance of the\r\nvirtual human. What if the virtual human’s ethnicity as well\r\nas gender matched that of the participant? Future work\r\nshould manipulate the virtual human’s age, gender, as well\r\nas ethnicity.\r\nFinally, since level of immersion was not a factor in\r\nenhancing social influence, future work should explore the\r\neffectiveness of simply having the virtual character as part\r\nof a desktop display.\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\nThe authors would like to thank Sabarish Babu for\r\nproviding code for rending the virtual human for the\r\nimmersive condition. The authors would also like to thank\r\nDr. Heather Richter for her advice and feedback in revising\r\nthis document.

Specically, we sought to replicate the classic social facilitation/inhibition effects\r\n\r\nwherein individuals’ performance on a task is affected by the presence of others. Within\r\n\r\nan IVE, participants mastered one of two tasks and subsequently performed the mas-\r\ntered or nonmastered task either alone or in the presence of a virtual human audience\r\n\r\nwhom they were led to believe were either computer-controlled agents or human-\r\ncontrolled avatars. Those performing in the presence of avatars demonstrated classic\r\n\r\nsocial inhibition performance impairment effects relative to those performing alone or in\r\nthe presence of agents. We discuss important elements involved in the experience of\r\nsocial inuence within immersive virtual environments.\r\n\r\n1 Int rod uct ion\r\n\r\nAn historical examination of research reports in social psychology yields a fas-\r\ncinating observation: the experimental methods employed are often as, and sometimes\r\n\r\nmore, interesting than the scientic ndings themselves. This is due largely to the\r\nscientic creativity exhibited in producing the illusory scenarios that are necessary to\r\n\r\nanswer important research questions in social psychology, a eld dened as “an at-\r\ntempt to understand and explain how the thought, feeling, and behavior of individu-\r\nals are inuenced by the actual, imagined or implied presence of others” (Allport,\r\n\r\n1985, p. 3). Some have even suggested that the history of methodology in experi-\r\nmental social psychology is a history, literally, of illusions (Korn, 1997).\r\n\r\n2 Illusion in Social Psy chology\r\n\r\nAlthough social psychologists relish the rigorous control of objective, empir-\r\nical investigations, it can prove quite difcult at times to perform the requisite ex-\r\nperimental manipulations in the laboratory. Often, we must induce affect, cogni-\r\ntions, and/or motivations in our participants, but the effect of our manipulations\r\n\r\nis limited both by the effect of our experimental illusions and by the participants’\r\nattentional, motivational, and imaginative capacities. Thus, we value experimenter\r\ncreativity in devising effective experimental scenarios that fuel the imaginations of\r\n\r\nour participants. Our experimental manipulations require us to make the assump-\r\ntion that our participants believe our illusions, whether by actively cooperating in\r\n\r\nstaged scenarios (such as role playing) or by believing our deceptive cover stories\r\n(Mixon, 1972).\r\n\r\nHoyt et al. 183\r\n\r\nCommon experimental manipulation techniques involve\r\n\r\nthe use of vignettes, verbal instructions, video and com-\r\nputer displays, and confederates. If given the opportunity,\r\n\r\nmost social psychologists would prefer to fully imbed their\r\nparticipants in vignettes or video displays or to have the\r\nsame confederate behave identically with all participants.\r\n\r\nThis capability would likely augment the attentional, moti-\r\nvational, and imaginative capacities of the participants, thus\r\n\r\nmaking it easier for experimenters to meet the assumption\r\nthat participants are psychologically experiencing what they\r\n\r\nwant them to experience. Fortunately, with recent techno-\r\nlogical advances, this ideal might not be so far fetched.\r\n\r\nSpecically, immersive virtual environment technology\r\n(IVET) may be the ultimate tool to help us meet the\r\n\r\nassumption of participant immersion in our experimen-\r\ntal illusions (Loomis, Blascovich, & Beall, 1999).\r\n\r\n3 Immer siv e Virtual Env ironment\r\nTechnology (IVET)\r\n\r\nModern IVET allows users to experience a com-\r\npelling sense of immersion within a circumambient envi-\r\nronment driven by a graphics computer. Blascovich et\r\n\r\nal. (2002) dene virtual environments (VEs) as syn-\r\nthetic sensory information that leads to perceptions of\r\n\r\nenvironments and their contents as if they were not syn-\r\nthetic. Indeed, social psychologists have been creating\r\n\r\nsynthetic experimental scenarios for years (for example,\r\nHaney, Banks, and Zimbardo’s (1973) simulated\r\n\r\nprison). Today, however, we can create immersive vir-\r\ntual environments using digital technology.1\r\n\r\n3 .1 Adv antages of Using IVET\r\nThe tradeoff between experimental control and\r\nmundane realism has plagued social psychology from its\r\ninception. Although researchers generally choose to\r\nmaximize experimental control, they are constantly\r\n\r\nsearching for new and creative methodologies to en-\r\nhance the mundane realism (that is, the extent to which\r\n\r\nan experiment is similar to situations encountered in\r\neveryday life (Aronson & Carlsmith, 1969)) of their\r\n\r\nexperiments. IVET is likely to provide social psychologi-\r\ncal researchers with an improvement (that is, a decrease)\r\n\r\nin this tradeoff by virtue of its more optimal interfaces\r\n\r\nfor the human senses. In addition, IVET provides re-\r\nsearchers with a tool that allows them to perform ma-\r\nnipulations that would be otherwise impossible or ex-\r\ntremely difcult. For example, IVET provides social\r\n\r\npsychologists with a relatively easy way to experimen-\r\ntally manipulate organismic variables such as race or\r\n\r\ngender, which was heretofore nearly impossible. Also,\r\nIVET provides social psychological researchers with an\r\nunobtrusive source of data from their participants. That\r\nis, participants’ movements are continually tracked by\r\nthe system and thus available for data collection. These\r\n\r\ndata can provide important information on social non-\r\nverbal cues such as nodding, posture, and eye gaze\r\n\r\n(Bailenson, Blascovich, Beall, & Loomis, 2001; Bailen-\r\nson, Beall, & Blascovich, 2002).\r\n\r\n3 .2 Social In uence within Immer siv e\r\nVirtual Env ironment s\r\nWe believe the experience of social inuence\r\nwithin immersive virtual environments is a function of a\r\nnumber of factors including realism and perceived\r\nagency. (See Blascovich (2002) and Blascovich et al.\r\n(2002) for reviews of IVET as a methodological tool.)\r\nRealism refers to the degree to which virtual humans\r\nand other objects within immersive virtual environments\r\nbehave as they would in the physical world, whereas\r\nperceived agency refers to the degree to which users\r\nbelieve they are in an environment with other veritable\r\n\r\nhumans. This study is concerned primarily with examin-\r\n1. We acknowledge that we use a denition that departs from those of\r\n\r\nother researchers in the eld of VEs who have tied their denitions to\r\ndigital technology, and we don’t do so lightly. However, we believe\r\nstrongly that our generic denition, which has appeared in more or less\r\nthe same form in several places in the published literature (Blascovich,\r\n2002; Blascovich et al., 2002) is important precisely because it is not tied\r\nto a specic technology. Technologies for creating virtual environments\r\nhave indeed changed over time and will continue to do so in the future,\r\nbut, the underlying principles of social interaction within virtual environ- ments may not be and most likely are not tied to specic technologies.\r\n\r\nHence, we can learn much from research in elds such as social psy-\r\nchology that has examined behaviors in virtual environments generi-\r\ncally dened and test and apply what we have learned to digital virtual\r\n\r\nenvironments, especially regarding social inuence and interaction.\r\n184 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\ning the role of perceived agency in social inuence\r\nwithin immersive virtual environments.\r\n\r\nIn our terminology, we use the term avatar to de-\r\nscribe a graphical character that is controlled by a hu-\r\nman being in real time. We use the term agent to refer\r\n\r\nto a graphical character that is controlled by a computer\r\nprogram or articial intelligence algorithm. Thus, an\r\navatar is the virtual embodiment or representation of a\r\n\r\nhuman interactant, and an agent is the virtual embodi-\r\nment of a computer program that has been designed to\r\n\r\ninteract with, or on behalf of, a human. The primary\r\npurpose of embodiment (that is, giving a human user or\r\na computerized agent a graphical representation within\r\na VE) is to give users the sense that there is someone\r\nelse present with them in a virtual environment (which\r\nis often referred to as a sense of copresence).\r\nGoffman (1963) suggested that copresence exists\r\nwhen people sense that they are able to perceive others\r\nand that those others are able to perceive them. To the\r\n\r\nextent that users feel copresent with another while en-\r\ngaged in an interaction within a VE, they should be-\r\ncome more involved and immersed in the interaction,\r\n\r\nand the presence of the other should exert greater social\r\ninuence. All else being equal, users should experience\r\nless copresence when interacting with agents compared\r\nto avatars. Thus, we expect greater levels of social inu- ence with avatars than with agents. However, as stated,\r\n\r\nwe believe other parameters, such as realism, also mod-\r\nerate this relationship. Indeed, Pertaub, Slater, and\r\n\r\nBarker (2002) showed how enhancing the realism of\r\nagents leads to social inuence (such as the induction of\r\nsocial anxiety and fear of public speaking). In this study,\r\nwe held realism constant at a minimal level to examine\r\nthe independent role of perceived agency in social inu- ence within immersive virtual environments.\r\n\r\n4 Classic Social In uence Effect s\r\n\r\nA promising approach to demonstrating the com-\r\nparability of IVET-based research to traditional meth-\r\nods is to attempt to replicate classic social inuence phe-\r\nnomena within IVEs. That is, comparing data from\r\n\r\nvirtual replications to the classic non-IVET obtained\r\n\r\neffects informs us about whether participants exhibit\r\nsimilar responses in both environments. Reliable and\r\nclassic social inuence phenomena that lend themselves\r\nwell to experimentation in an IVE are the well-known\r\nsocial facilitation and social inhibition effects.\r\n\r\n4 .1 Social Facilitat ion and Social\r\nInhibit ion\r\n\r\nFrom Triplett’s (1898) seminal investigation dem-\r\nonstrating that children perform better when winding\r\n\r\nshing reels in a group setting than alone, to contempo-\r\nrary research into biopsychosocial accounts of the effects\r\n\r\nof presence of others on performance (Blascovich,\r\nMendes, Hunter, & Salomon, 1999), social facilitation\r\nand inhibition effects have had a profound impact on\r\nthe eld of social psychology. Initially, social facilitation\r\n\r\nreferred to the presence of co-actors enhancing perfor-\r\nmance (Triplett, 1898). However, subsequent research\r\n\r\nhas more clearly dened the effect of the presence of\r\n\r\nothers on performance. Social facilitation refers to en-\r\nhancement effects, and social inhibition refers to the\r\n\r\nimpairment effects driven by the presence of others,\r\nwhether they are co-actors or mere observers.\r\nZajonc’s (1965) landmark review and analysis of the\r\nearly literature on social facilitation and social inhibition\r\neffects revived theoretical accounts and debate about\r\n\r\nthe phenomenon. Zajonc demonstrated that the pres-\r\nence of others serves to enhance performance on well-\r\nlearned, or dominant, responses but impairs perfor-\r\nmance on novel, or subordinate, responses. He\r\n\r\nproposed a theoretical model of social facilitation and\r\ninhibition effects that is dependent on arousal and task\r\ncomplexity. Specically, he posited that the presence of\r\nothers increases arousal that in turn facilitates dominant\r\n\r\nresponses and impairs subordinate responses. Thus, per-\r\nformance on well-learned tasks is augmented by the\r\n\r\npresence of others whereas performance on novel tasks\r\nis diminished. Zajonc specied that this generalized\r\narousal is a novel response to the presence of others.\r\n\r\nShortly after Zajonc’s model appeared, various theo-\r\nrists added to the knowledge of social facilitation and\r\n\r\ninhibition processes (Taylor, Peplau, & Sears, 1997).\r\n\r\nEvaluation apprehension theorists explained that, on sim-\r\nHoyt et al. 185\r\n\r\nple tasks, an awareness that we are being judged can moti-\r\nvate us to greater effort; on complex tasks, however, the\r\n\r\npressure of evaluation may be harmful. Specically, Cot-\r\ntrell, Wack, Sekerak, and Rittle (1968) proposed and\r\n\r\ntested the notion that facilitation of dominant responses\r\n\r\nstems from anticipated evaluations from others and, in-\r\ndeed, found facilitation effects only when others could\r\n\r\nevaluate the participants’ performance.\r\n\r\n5 Social Facilitat ion and Virtual\r\nEnv ironment s: Exper imental Ov erv iew\r\n\r\nIn this experiment, we attempted to replicate so-\r\ncial facilitation and social inhibition effects in an immer-\r\nsive virtual setting. Successful replication would provide\r\n\r\ninsight into the conditions necessary for the IVE user to\r\n\r\nexperience social inuence effects. Specically, partici-\r\npants in this study learned either a categorization or\r\n\r\npattern recognition task to criterion and subsequently\r\nwere randomly assigned to perform either the same or a\r\n\r\ndifferent task alone or in the presence of two virtual ob-\r\nservers. The perceived agency of the virtual observers\r\n\r\nwas manipulated such that half of the participants\r\nwere led to believe they were being observed by two\r\ncomputer-controlled agents, and the other half were led\r\nto believe that the virtual observers were avatars (that is,\r\nrepresentations of other real people who were in the\r\nvirtual environment with them).\r\n\r\nBased on the social evaluation inherent in the situa-\r\ntion, we hypothesized that social facilitation and social\r\n\r\ninhibition would be exhibited in the avatar but not the\r\n\r\nagent or alone conditions. In addition, we expected par-\r\nticipants in the avatar condition to report a greater sense\r\n\r\nof copresence than would participants in the agent con-\r\ndition and that this enhanced sense of copresence would\r\n\r\nat least partially mediate any differences in performance\r\nbetween participants in the agent and avatar conditions.\r\n5 .1 Method\r\n5.1.1 Design and Overview. To test for social\r\ninuence in the virtual environment, we conducted a 2\r\n(task type: novel or well-learned) 3 3 (audience type:\r\n\r\nagent, avatar, or alone) fully factorial between-partici-\r\npants experiment. The experiment consisted of two\r\n\r\nphases: learning and testing. Participants rst learned\r\n\r\none of two randomly assigned tasks to a predened cri-\r\nterion. In the testing phase, participants were randomly\r\n\r\nassigned to perform the learned or the unlearned task\r\n\r\neither alone, in the presence of an agent, or in the pres-\r\nence of an avatar. The two tasks were counterbalanced\r\n\r\nwithin the experimental design.\r\n\r\n5.1.2 Settings and Participants. The experi-\r\nment was conducted at the University of California– Santa Barbara. Forty-eight undergraduate students ei-\r\nther received course credit in introductory psychology\r\n\r\nor were paid $10.00 for their participation. Nine partici-\r\npants were excluded from analyses due to their failure to\r\n\r\nlearn to criterion in the rst phase. Thus, data from 39\r\nparticipants (15 men and 24 women) are reported.\r\n5.1.3 Apparatus. In this experiment, participants\r\nwere immersed in a three-dimensional digital virtual\r\nlaboratory environment. The immersive virtual display\r\nsystem used to engage the participants consisted of\r\nthree subsystems: a head tracker, a graphics computer,\r\nand an audiovisual head-mounted display (HMD).\r\n(See gure 1.)\r\nDue to constant technological advancements in our\r\nlab, the type of head tracker used in this experiment was\r\nchanged after roughly one-fourth of the participants\r\ntook part in the experiment. The rst tracking system\r\ndetected only head rotation whereas the second system\r\ndetected translation as well. The rst head tracker was\r\nan Intersense IS-300 series precision motion tracker\r\nwith three degrees of freedom to detect yaw, pitch, and\r\nroll; the angular resolution for the Intersense was 0.02\r\ndeg. The head tracker used for the remainder of the\r\n\r\nparticipants was Shooting Star’s model ADL-1 goniom-\r\neter which had six degrees of freedom to detect motion\r\n\r\nalong the x, y, and z coordinates as well as yaw, pitch,\r\nand roll rotations.\r\nA 400 MHz Pentium II PC with 128 MB of RAM\r\ngenerated a stream of images for each eye. The core\r\nrendering software, Vizard, was designed in-house, and\r\ncontained an OpenGL-based graphics library. Python,\r\n\r\n186 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\nan object-oriented programming language, was used to\r\nscript interactive behaviors in the IVE. Initially, software\r\non a separate PC (a 300 MHz Pentium II with 64 MB\r\nof RAM) was used to determine the orientation of the\r\nhead and then communicated that information to the\r\ngraphics computer over an RS-232 serial line running at\r\n38,400 baud. Later, the tracking software was installed\r\non the graphics computer itself. The peripheral button\r\nbox from which the participants gave their responses\r\n\r\nwas read from a digital I/O port of Advantech’s PCL-\r\n812 multi I/O card.\r\n\r\nThe HMD was a Virtual Research V8 consisting of a\r\nbinocular LCD display with 6403480 resolution. This\r\nexperiment was conducted in unocular model (the same\r\nimage projected to both eyes). The eld of view of the\r\ndisplay was 60 deg. diagonal. The HMDs used by the\r\nconfederate assistants, who were ostensibly in the same\r\nvirtual environment as the participant, wore Philips\r\nMagnavox Scuba FX virtual immersion visors.\r\n5.1.4 Stimuli. Off-the-shelf modeling programs\r\nwere used to create the VRML-based 3D models for the\r\n\r\nvirtual laboratory. The virtual laboratory setting con-\r\nsisted of a room with simulated dimensions of approxi-\r\nmately 333 m. Additionally, there was a wooden door\r\n\r\n(approximately 132.5 m) on the northeast wall, and a\r\nconsole with a computer screen situated directly in front\r\nof the participant.\r\nThe 3D models of the virtual observers were also\r\nmade using the 3D modeling software. One male and\r\n\r\none female observer were created to approximately life-\r\nsize proportions. (See gure 2.) The models were cre-\r\nated in a modular fashion to allow for realistic simula-\r\ntions of three basic nonverbal behaviors: eye movement,\r\n\r\nhead movement, and blinking. Specically, the eyes,\r\n\r\neyelids, heads, and bodies were separate images con-\r\ntrolled independently in the environment. The observ-\r\ners were programmed to randomly generate horizontal\r\n\r\neye movements, eye blinks, and head rotations along\r\nthe yaw, pitch, and roll dimensions to simulate subtle\r\nhead movement.\r\n5.1.5 Performance Tasks. The tasks were\r\nadapted from Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter, and\r\n\r\nSalomon’s (1999) pattern recognition and categoriza-\r\ntion tasks, the latter of which was an adapted version of\r\n\r\nMaddox and Ashby’s (1996) perceptual boundary exer-\r\ncise. These tasks were designed to be equivalent in dif-\r\n\r\nculty yet distinct both visually and substantively. In both\r\ntasks, the participants’ goal was to learn, via feedback,\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Immersive virtual display system.\r\n\r\nFigure 2. The virtual observers.\r\n\r\nHoyt et al. 187\r\n\r\nthe elements by which visual stimuli were sorted into\r\n\r\none of two groups. Specically, participants in the cate-\r\ngorization task were presented with two numbers on\r\n\r\nthe virtual computer screen and were required to deter-\r\nmine whether the numbers belonged to one of two cat-\r\negories. In the pattern recognition task, on the other\r\n\r\nhand, participants viewed a 535 letter matrix on the vir-\r\ntual computer screen, and a word in the matrix was high-\r\nlighted. The participants’ task was to determine whether\r\n\r\nthe word was highlighted in the correct pattern or not.\r\nThe tasks were implemented using Python, and the\r\n\r\nstimuli were presented to participants on a virtual com-\r\nputer screen in a virtual laboratory setting. These tasks\r\n\r\nrequired an interactive series of images projected on the\r\nvirtual computer screen. Specically, the numbers used\r\nin the categorization task were 3D objects that were\r\ntranslated to the appropriate location on the virtual\r\n\r\ncomputer screen whereas the letter matrices of the pat-\r\ntern-recognition task consisted of a series of JPEG com-\r\npressed images that were used as textures mapped di-\r\nrectly onto the virtual computer screen.\r\n\r\nParticipants gave their responses by pressing one of\r\n\r\ntwo buttons on a peripheral device that sent the infor-\r\nmation to the rendering PC, and all responses were\r\n\r\nwritten out to a data collection le. Participants were\r\nprovided immediate audio feedback: a high-pitched\r\ntone followed a correct response and a low-pitched tone\r\nfollowed an incorrect response. If the participants did\r\nnot respond within three to four seconds, their response\r\nwas recorded as incorrect, the low-pitched tone was\r\nplayed, and the next trial ensued.\r\nThe categorization rules for the two tasks varied. In the\r\ncategorization task, the two randomly generated numbers\r\non the computer screen were categorized according to the\r\nnormal distribution to which they belonged. Specically,\r\nthe numbers in group 1 came from a normal distribution\r\nof integers with m 5 46.5, s 5 8, a lower limit of 25, and\r\na higher limit of 68. The normal distribution for the group\r\n2 numbers had a m 5 90.7, s 5 8, and a limited range of\r\n\r\n69 to 112. In the pattern recognition task, the correct pat-\r\ntern consisted of the letters being highlighted one at a\r\n\r\ntime to form a right angle regardless of rotation. Addition-\r\nally, the correct pattern consisted of the letters being high-\r\nlighted consecutively adjacent to one another to form the\r\n\r\nright-angle pattern.\r\nParticipants were randomly assigned to learn one of the\r\ntwo tasks to criterion. Specically, they were required to\r\nmeet or exceed the criterion of getting 80% correct on two\r\nconsecutive blocks. The categorization task consisted of 25\r\ntrials per block, and each block in the pattern recognition\r\ntask was composed of ten trials. During the testing phase\r\nof the experiment the participants completed ve full\r\nblocks of the task. For both tasks, the participants received\r\nfeedback regarding their overall performance following the\r\ncompletion of each block.\r\n\r\n5.1.6 Procedure. Prior to the experiment, par-\r\nticipants were screened by telephone regarding their\r\n\r\nsusceptibility to motion sickness, and vulnerable individ-\r\nuals were not retained for participation. Upon arrival at\r\n\r\nthe experiment site, participants completed another sim-\r\nulator sickness questionnaire as a precaution, provided\r\n\r\ntheir informed consent, and were given instructions re-\r\ngarding the experimental procedures. Next, while\r\n\r\nseated, the participants put on the HMD and began the\r\npractice portion of the experiment. During the practice\r\n\r\nphase, the participants were instructed on how to per-\r\nform both tasks. Specically, they were told the objec-\r\ntive of the tasks, shown how to provide their responses\r\n\r\non a button box, and were led through a sample trial for\r\neach task to familiarize them with the procedures and\r\nthe tones following the correct and incorrect responses.\r\nFollowing this short practice phase, the participants\r\nbegan the learning phase of the experiment. They were\r\ninstructed that following each block (consisting of 25\r\n\r\ntrials in the categorization task and ten trials in the pat-\r\ntern recognition task) they would receive feedback re-\r\ngarding their performance. Participants were required to\r\n\r\nget 80% correct on two consecutive blocks to success-\r\nfully complete the learning phase of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe experimenter informed the participants that she\r\nwould monitor the experimental room via a live audio\r\nand video feed from the adjoining room, and she left\r\nthe experimental room as the participant began the\r\nlearning phase.\r\n\r\nAfter the participants either learned the task to crite-\r\nrion or completed all possible blocks, the experimenter\r\n\r\n188 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\nreturned and instructed them to remove the HMD for a\r\nshort rest period. During the rest period, participants\r\nreceived instructions specic to their randomly assigned\r\nconditions. Participants assigned to the well-learned task\r\ncondition were informed that they would be performing\r\n\r\nthe same task that they had just completed, and partici-\r\npants in the novel task condition were informed that\r\n\r\nthey would perform the other task.\r\nThose participants in the no-audience condition (that is,\r\nthose performing alone) were simply told they would be\r\ncompleting ve full blocks of their randomly selected task\r\n(novel or well-learned), whereas those assigned to the\r\nagent audience condition were told that during the task\r\nthey were going to be joined in the virtual laboratory by\r\ntwo computer-controlled virtual observers. Finally, in the\r\navatar condition, two assistants entered the experimental\r\nroom with HMDs and goniometers, ostensibly set the\r\nequipment up, and took a seat adjacent to the participants.\r\nThe experimenter informed the participants that these two\r\nassistants would be joining them in the virtual world as\r\nobservers. Additionally, the participants were shown color\r\n\r\npictures of what the observers would look like in the vir-\r\ntual environment and, to augment the illusion, participants\r\n\r\nwere then shown bogus pictures of what they would look\r\nlike in the IVE. That is, participants were presented with a\r\npicture of a virtual human character that matched their\r\ngender, and they were told that this was what they would\r\n\r\nlook like to the two observers within the virtual environ-\r\nment. Only those in the avatar condition were shown rep-\r\nresentations of themselves in an attempt to increase their\r\n\r\nunderstanding of how individuals can be embodied in a\r\nvirtual world.\r\nAs the experimenter exited the room, the participants\r\nbegan the test segment of the experiment in which they\r\ncompleted ve full blocks of one of the two tasks. Upon\r\n\r\ncompletion of the testing phase, the participants com-\r\npleted a short questionnaire and were debriefed and\r\n\r\nthanked for their participation.\r\n5 .2 Measures\r\n\r\n5.2.1 Simulator Sickness Susceptibility Ques-\r\ntionnaire. Before the experiment began, participants\r\n\r\nwere asked to indicate their level of motion sickness sus-\r\nceptibility on a nine-item questionnaire that was devel-\r\noped for this study. Sample items included “Do you get\r\n\r\ncar sick?” and “Do you get sick in airplanes?” No partic-\r\nipants experienced any signicant simulator sickness\r\n\r\nsymptoms at any time during the experiment.\r\n5.2.2 Task Novelty, Task Anxiety, and\r\nCopresence. Upon completion of the experiment,\r\n\r\nparticipants completed a short questionnaire (see Ap-\r\npendix) consisting of three subscales: task novelty (two\r\n\r\nitems, Cronbach’s a 5 .94), task anxiety (two items,\r\nCronbach’s a 5 .72), and copresence (seven items,\r\nCronbach’s a 5 .95). Specically, participants indicated\r\non a seven-point Likert-type scale the extent to which\r\nthe task they performed in the testing phase was novel\r\n(for example, “When I began the nal task, I felt I knew\r\nhow to perform it well” [reversed scored]), the extent\r\nto which they felt anxious about performing the task\r\n(“When I began the nal task, I was nervous”), and, in\r\nthe agent and avatar audience conditions, the extent to\r\n\r\nwhich they felt like there were other real people copre-\r\nsent with them in the virtual environment (“I perceived\r\n\r\nI was in the presence of real people when the virtual\r\n\r\nothers were in the room” or “The virtual others ap-\r\npeared to be sentient (conscious and alive) to me.”)\r\n\r\n5 .3 Result s\r\n5.3.1 Manipulation Checks\r\n5.3.1.1 Task Novelty. The results of a 2 (task type:\r\nnovel or well-learned) 3 3 (audience type: avatar, agent,\r\n\r\nor alone) analysis of variance conrmed that the partici-\r\npants who performed the novel task during the testing\r\n\r\nphase reported that the novel task was signicantly more\r\nnovel (M 5 7.05, s.d. 5 4.05) compared to those who\r\nperformed the well-learned task (M 5 3.00, s.d. 5\r\n1.20), F (1, 33) 5 17.12, p , .001, (h\r\n2 5 .34).\r\n5.3.1.2 Task Anxiety. The results of a 2 (task type:\r\nnovel or well-learned) 3 3 (audience type: avatar, agent,\r\nor alone) analysis of variance also conrmed that the\r\nparticipants who performed the novel task during the\r\ntesting phase reported signicantly higher levels of task\r\nHoyt et al. 189\r\n\r\nanxiety (M 5 5.45, s.d. 5 2.95) compared to partici-\r\npants in the well-learned task condition (M 5 3.53, s.d. 5 1.78), F (1, 33) 5 6.48, p , .05, (h\r\n\r\n2 5 .16).2\r\n5.3.1.3 Copresence. The results of a 2 (task type:\r\nnovel or well-learned) 3 2 (audience type: avatar or\r\nagent) analysis of variance also revealed a strong main\r\neffect of audience type. Specically, participants in the\r\n\r\navatar condition (M 5 36.00, s.d. 5 6.16) reported sig-\r\nnicantly higher levels of copresence than participants in\r\n\r\nthe agent condition (M 5 22.30, s.d. 5 7.07), F (1,\r\n23) 5 32.76, p , .001, (h\r\n\r\n2 5 .59). In addition, there\r\nwas a signicant main effect of task type, F (1, 23) 5\r\n5.64, p , .05 (h\r\n\r\n2 5 .20), which indicated that partici-\r\npants in the learned task condition (M 5 31.65, s.d. 5\r\n\r\n8.50) reported signicantly greater levels of copresence\r\nthan those in the novel task condition (M 5 25.36,\r\ns.d. 5 9.74).3\r\n5.3.2 Analysis of Task Performance Data.\r\nTask performance scores from the testing phase were\r\ncomputed by summing the number of correct responses\r\nacross the ve blocks and converting the result to the\r\n\r\nproportion correct out of all possible trials. Initial analy-\r\nses revealed no signicant main effects for sex or stimuli\r\n\r\ntype (that is, pattern recognition or categorization task)\r\nand no interactions of sex or stimuli type with either\r\nof the two main independent variables. Thus, we\r\ncollapsed across stimuli type and sex for the remaining\r\nanalyses.4\r\n\r\n5.3.2.1 Main Effects Tests. The mean task perfor-\r\nmance scores were submitted to a 3 (audience type: ava-\r\ntar or agent or alone) 3 2 (task type: well-learned or\r\n\r\nnovel) analysis of covariance with task anxiety and task\r\nnovelty entered as covariates.5 Results of this analysis\r\n\r\nrevealed a signicant main effect for task type such that,\r\n\r\nas expected, participants in the well-learned task condi-\r\ntion (M 5 .93, s.d. 5 .06) performed signicantly better\r\n\r\nthan participants in the novel task condition (M 5 .75,\r\ns.d. 5 .17), F (1, 31) 5 7.48, p , .01, (h\r\n2 5 .19).\r\nThere was also a signicant main effect of audience, F\r\n(2, 31) 5 3.71, p , .05, (h\r\n\r\n2 5 .19). Results of planned\r\ncontrasts revealed that participants performed signi-\r\ncantly worse across both tasks (that is, well-learned and\r\nnovel) in the presence of the avatar observers (M 5 .77,\r\ns.d. 5 .21) compared to when they performed in the\r\npresence of the agent observers (M 5 .89, s.d. 5 .08),\r\np , .05. Moreover, participants performed marginally\r\n\r\nworse when performing in front of the two avatar ob-\r\nservers compared to when performing alone (M 5 .85,\r\n\r\ns.d. 5 .15), p , .10.\r\n\r\n5.3.2.2 Hypothesis Testing: Assessing the Social Fa-\r\ncilitation Hypothesis. As can be seen in gure 3, these\r\n\r\nmain effects were qualied, by a signicant audience\r\ntype 3 task type interaction, F (2, 31) 5 3.36, p , .05,\r\n(h\r\n\r\n2 5 .18). To further examine the nature of the inter-\r\naction, we performed simple main effects tests and\r\n\r\nplanned contrasts to compare the three audience condi-\r\ntions within each task type (well-learned or novel). First,\r\n\r\nthe simple main effect of audience type was examined\r\n\r\n2. The possible range of scores for both the task novelty and task\r\nanxiety subscales was 2 to 14.\r\n3. The possible range of scores for the copresence subscale was 7\r\nto 49.\r\n4. We also did not include sex as a factor in subsequent analyses\r\ndue to the small sample size.\r\n5. The pattern of results without including task anxiety and task\r\nnovelty as covariates is identical, although the task type 3 audience\r\ninteraction is only marginally signicant (p , .10).\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Mean task performance as a function of audience type\r\n(avatar or agent or no audience) and task type (well-learned or\r\nnovel). Bars with different letters indicate that the means differ\r\nsignicantly at the p , .05 level.\r\n\r\n190 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\nwithin the well-learned task condition to test for the\r\nsocial facilitation effect. We had hypothesized that those\r\n\r\nparticipants performing a well-learned task in the pres-\r\nence of avatar observers would perform signicantly bet-\r\nter than those performing either alone or in the pres-\r\nence of agent observers. Contrary to our hypothesis,\r\n\r\nhowever, the results of this analysis revealed that there\r\nwere no signicant differences in performance across the\r\nthree audience types, F , 1.\r\n\r\nThis nding was not completely unexpected, how-\r\never, as it most likely reects a ceiling effect associated\r\n\r\nwith the well-learned task. Specically, because partici-\r\npants were required to learn the rst task to an 80% cri-\r\nterion, there was little room for improvement in the\r\n\r\nwell-learned task condition. Once participants learned\r\nthe appropriate categorization strategy in the learning\r\nphase, there was very little variability in their scores in\r\n\r\nthe testing phase. (See Bond and Titus’ 1983 meta-\r\nanalysis of social facilitation research for an explication\r\n\r\nand review of this problem in social facilitation re-\r\nsearch.)\r\n\r\n5.3.2.3 Hypothesis Testing: Assessing the Social Inhi-\r\nbition Hypothesis. Next, the simple main effect of audi-\r\nence condition was examined within the novel task con-\r\ndition to test for the social inhibition effect. We had\r\n\r\nhypothesized that those participants performing a novel\r\ntask in the presence of avatar observers would perform\r\n\r\nsignicantly worse than those performing either alone\r\nor in the presence of agent observers. As predicted,\r\nthere was a signicant simple main effect of audience\r\ncondition, F (2, 31) 5 7.01, p , .01, (h\r\n2 5 .31),\r\nwithin the novel task condition. Specically, planned\r\ncontrasts comparing the three audience types revealed\r\nthat participants performing in the presence of the two\r\n\r\navatar observers (M 5 .62, s.d. 5 .20) performed signif-\r\nicantly worse than did participants performing either in\r\n\r\nthe presence of the two agent observers (M 5 .84, s.d. 5 .05) or alone (M 5 .78, s.d. 5 .18), ps , .05. As ex-\r\npected, however, the difference in performance between\r\n\r\nparticipants in the agent and no audience (that is, alone)\r\nconditions was not statistically signicant.\r\n\r\n5.3.3 Mediational Analyses. To test the hy-\r\npothesis that copresence would at least partially mediate\r\n\r\nthe relationship between perceived agency (that is,\r\nwhether the audience was composed of avatars or\r\nagents) and task performance, a mediational analysis was\r\nconducted within the novel task condition (because that\r\nwas the condition in which social inhibition was found).\r\nFollowing Baron and Kenny’s (1986) procedures, the\r\ndirect relationship between perceived agency and task\r\nperformance was rst assessed. As can be seen in gure\r\n\r\n4, there was a strong, negative association between per-\r\nceived agency and task performance indicating that per-\r\nformance within the novel task condition was signi-\r\n\r\nFigure 4. Copresence as a mediator of the relationship between perceived agency and task\r\nperformance within the novel task condition. Path coefcients are standardized regression coefcients\r\n(b) and coefcients in parentheses indicate nonmediated (direct) effects.\r\n\r\nHoyt et al. 191\r\n\r\ncantly worse in the avatar audience condition than in\r\nthe agent audience condition, R\r\n\r\n2 5 .43, F (1, 12) 5\r\n\r\n9.12, p , .05.\r\nSecond, the association between perceived agency\r\n\r\nand copresence was assessed. Results of a standard re-\r\ngression analysis indicated that perceived agency was\r\n\r\nsignicantly, positively associated with copresence, indi-\r\ncating that participants in the avatar audience condition\r\n\r\nexperienced signicantly greater copresence than did\r\nthose in the agent condition, R\r\n\r\n2 5 .71, F (1, 12) 5\r\n29.63, p , .001. The standardized path coefcient (b)\r\nis shown in gure 4.\r\nBecause the initial criteria for establishing mediation\r\nwere met (that is, the predictor variable was signicantly\r\nrelated to both the outcome variable and the mediator),\r\ntask performance was then regressed on perceived\r\nagency and copresence. The results of this analysis were\r\nconsistent with a mediational hypothesis. Specically,\r\ncopresence appeared to fully mediate the relationship\r\nbetween perceived agency and task performance (as re-\r\nected by the perceived agency, task performance path\r\ncoefcient being reduced to the point where it was no\r\nlonger signicantly different from zero). Moreover, the\r\nstandardized path coefcient between copresence and\r\ntask performance was signicantly different from zero,\r\neven when controlling for the effects of the perceived\r\nagency manipulation. Overall, the model was statistically\r\nsignicant, and it accounted for a signicant proportion\r\nof the variance in task performance, R\r\n\r\n2 5 .68, F (2,\r\n\r\n11) 5 11.80, p , .01.\r\n\r\n6 Discussion\r\nImmersive virtual environment technology has\r\ngreat potential for scholars and researchers in a variety\r\nof elds (Blascovich, 2002; Blascovich et al., 2002;\r\nLoomis, Blascovich, & Beall, 1999; Valente & Bardini,\r\n1995). The experiment reported here increases our con-\r\ndence in the technology’s utility for the study of social\r\ninuence. Indeed, we successfully replicated the social\r\ninhibition effect within an IVE. In addition, we found\r\nthat the greater the sense of copresence users reported\r\nexperiencing within the virtual environment, the more\r\n\r\nthe presence of others inuenced their behavior. Finally,\r\n\r\nwe found that copresence fully mediated the relation-\r\nship between perceived agency (that is, whether partici-\r\npants thought the virtual observers were avatars or\r\n\r\nagents) and participants’ performance on a novel task.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, ceiling effects prevented us from de-\r\ntecting social facilitation (such as performance enhance-\r\nment on a well-learned task while performing in the\r\n\r\npresence of others) in this study. That is, contrary to\r\nour hypothesis, participants performing a well-learned\r\ntask in front of an audience of avatars did not perform\r\nsignicantly better than did those performing alone or\r\n\r\nin the presence of an audience of agents. Further re-\r\nsearch will need to determine the exact nature of perfor-\r\nmance enhancement effects in IVEs, perhaps using a\r\n\r\ndifferent kind of task or employing a different learning\r\ncriterion whereby ceiling effects are less likely to occur.\r\nAs hypothesized, social inhibition did not occur when\r\nparticipants performed a novel task in the presence of\r\nagents, but it did occur when participants performed in\r\n\r\nfront of an audience of avatars. Our results are consis-\r\ntent with prior interpretations of social inhibition. Spe-\r\ncically, the replication of social inhibition in the pres-\r\nence of avatars, and not in the presence of agents, can\r\n\r\nbe explained by the evaluative nature of the two types of\r\nobservers. That is, the agents may have been construed\r\nas non-evaluative and the avatars may have been viewed\r\nas evaluative. Thus, in accordance with the evaluation\r\napprehension hypothesis of social inhibition, the dearth\r\n\r\nof social inhibition effects when performing in the pres-\r\nence of agents stems from the notion that they are non-\r\nevaluative (Cottrell et al., 1968).\r\n\r\n6 .1 Design Implicat ions: An\r\nEx aminat ion of Audience Type, Response Type, and Realism\r\n\r\nThe results of this study, along with others re-\r\ncently conducted by social psychologists (Bailenson et\r\n\r\nal., 2002; Bailenson et al., 2001; Swinth & Blascovich,\r\n\r\n2001), demonstrate that many of the basic social pro-\r\ncesses that are observed in nonmediated human-human\r\n\r\ninteractions also occur within virtual environments. This\r\nnding gives us greater condence that multiuser virtual\r\n\r\n192 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\nenvironments can be used successfully for collaboration,\r\ntraining, and education because the ensuing interactions\r\n\r\nappear to be governed by many of the same social dy-\r\nnamics as face-to-face interactions.\r\n\r\nHowever, these results also suggest that, contrary to\r\nwhat has been proposed by some researchers (such as\r\nReeves & Nass, 1996), people do not always respond to\r\nhuman-like agents as they would to other real people.\r\nAlthough we have discussed elsewhere the situations\r\nwhen we believe human-human and human-computer\r\ninteractions are most likely to differ (Blascovich et al.,\r\n\r\n2002; Blascovich, 2002), one of the factors that is im-\r\nportant to consider is the type of response one wishes to\r\n\r\nassess. With low-level, automatic, responses (such as\r\nmaintaining appropriate interpersonal distance), one’s\r\nbeliefs about whether one is interacting with an agent or\r\nan avatar appears not to matter very much. However,\r\nwhen dealing with higher-level, controlled processes\r\n(such as was the case in this study of social inhibition),\r\none’s beliefs about whether one is interacting with an\r\nagent or an avatar appears to matter a great deal.\r\nAs we have also argued elsewhere (Blascovich, 2002;\r\nBlascovich et al., 2002), when users believe they are\r\ninteracting with agents rather than avatars, some level of\r\n\r\nrealism (most importantly, social or interactional real-\r\nism) is necessary for social inuence and meaningful\r\n\r\nsocial interaction to occur. Moreover, the amount of\r\nrealism required is a function of the level of behavior\r\none wishes to assess, with greater realism required for\r\nhigher-level behaviors. In interactions involving avatars,\r\nhowever, realism appears not to matter as much because\r\n\r\nthe mere belief that one is interacting with another per-\r\nson may be sufcient to induce thoughts, feelings, and\r\n\r\nbehaviors that are characteristic of typical human-hu-\r\nman interactions (Bailenson et al, 2001; Swinth & Blas-\r\ncovich, 2001).\r\n\r\nIn this study, for example, we examined fairly high-\r\nlevel social behaviors. According to one explanation of\r\n\r\nsocial inhibition, the decreased performance observed\r\nwhen someone performs a novel task in the presence of\r\n\r\nothers is caused by evaluation apprehension. In the ex-\r\nperiment reported here, we purposefully maintained a\r\n\r\nlow level of realism for our virtual characters because we\r\nwanted to observe the independent effect of audience\r\n\r\ntype (agents or avatars) on their performance and per-\r\nceptions of those virtual characters. In doing so, we\r\n\r\nfound that social inhibition was only observed when\r\nindividuals performed in front of virtual characters that\r\nthey believed represented other real people rather than\r\nwhen they thought they were merely agents, probably\r\nbecause they did not view the agents as evaluative in\r\nthis study.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, Pertaub et al. (2002) demon-\r\nstrated that enhancing the realism of agents can lead to\r\n\r\nsocial inuence, even for high-level responses such as\r\n\r\nthe induction of social anxiety and fear of public speak-\r\ning. Pertaub et al. examined the anxiety responses of\r\n\r\npeople giving a ve-minute presentation to an audience\r\n\r\nof eight agents. They found that, even though partici-\r\npants knew they were speaking in front of an audience\r\n\r\nof agents, those who performed in front of the highly\r\n\r\nrealistic, negative audience exhibited high levels of anxi-\r\nety and self-reported somatic symptoms. One explana-\r\ntion for this nding is that the negative audience ap-\r\npeared highly evaluative, and thus performance on a\r\n\r\ndifcult task was impaired even though the audience\r\nwas composed solely of agents.\r\nOverall, the results from this research have numerous\r\nimplications for those who design and use multiuser\r\n\r\nvirtual environments for research, training, collabora-\r\ntion, entertainment, and other purposes. We suggest\r\n\r\nthat VE designers should engage in a cost-benet analy-\r\nsis when designing a VE to determine the level of real-\r\nism that is necessary. Specically, we propose that\r\n\r\nrealism is most important in VEs supporting social\r\ninteraction with agents, especially when one wishes to\r\ninuence or assess higher-level responses. In sum,\r\ndesigners should consider whether users will interact\r\nwith agents or avatars and the types of interaction likely\r\n\r\nto occur when developing multiuser virtual environ-\r\nments.\r\n\r\n6 .2 Limitat ions and Suggest ions for\r\nFuture Research\r\nUnfortunately, there is a potential but unlikely\r\n\r\nconfound in this study that should be explored by fu-\r\nture research. Specically, the effect of having the re-\r\nHoyt et al. 193\r\n\r\nsearch assistants physically present in the experimental\r\n\r\nroom in the avatar audience condition needs to be de-\r\ntermined by running control conditions in which there\r\n\r\nare real people present in the experimental room but\r\nnot in the IVE and in which there are avatars present in\r\n\r\nthe IVE but no real people physically present in the ex-\r\nperimental room. However, the results from other re-\r\nsearch (Bailenson et al., in press; Bailenson et al., 2001;\r\n\r\nSwinth & Blascovich, 2001) suggest that one’s belief\r\nthat one is in the presence of an avatar is sufcient to\r\ninduce social inuence. For example, Swinth and\r\nBlascovich found that individuals demonstrate greater\r\nconformity when they think that they are interacting\r\nwith avatars compared to when they think they are\r\ninteracting with agents, even when they are in reality\r\ninteracting with agents and no people are physically\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nBecause immersive virtual environments that can si-\r\nmultaneously be shared by real and virtual people pro-\r\nvide great promise for communications, collaboration,\r\n\r\ncultural exchange, and social research, the issue of social\r\ninteraction in immersive virtual environments has come\r\ninto prominence. Hopefully, with the vested interest of\r\nvarious researchers and entrepreneurs, we can rapidly\r\ndevelop a clear understanding of the elements of social\r\n\r\nrelations within a virtual environment. Once the neces-\r\nsary and sufcient conditions of the phenomenological\r\n\r\nexperience of others in a virtual world have been identi-\r\ned, new chapters in both virtual environmental and\r\nexperimental social psychological theory and research\r\nwill be opened.\r\n\r\nAck nowledgment s\r\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Science\r\nFoundation (SBR-9872084 and SBR-9873432) to the second\r\nauthor.'),

Some pioneering companies have deployed innova-\r\ntive features to provide “live help” that assists online shoppers when they search\r\n\r\nfor specific merchandise and that answers shoppers’ questions instantly through\r\nreal-time communications with sales associates.\r\nLive help is distinguished from other online customer-support functions in that\r\nit involves real employees providing assistance to customers (Aberg & Shahmehri,\r\n\r\n2003). Currently, most live help services are implemented through instant text chat-\r\nting between shoppers and customer service representatives (CSRs). These conver-\r\nsations can be initiated either by a customer or by a CSR who engages customers\r\n\r\nproactively by greeting them and inviting them to chat online. Notably, instant in-\r\nteractions in this form have been identified as an important factor bolstering\r\n\r\nLands’ End’s e-commerce success (Dukcevich, 2002); the average value of an order\r\n\r\nincreases by 6% when a potential customer uses the live help function, and an on-\r\nline visitor who uses Lands’ End’s instant messaging is 20% more likely to com-\r\nplete a purchase than one who does not.\r\n\r\nThis study focuses primarily on the interface design of live help features pro-\r\nvided by online shopping Web sites. Although significant progress has been made\r\n\r\nwith real-time multimedia collaboration technologies, which have proved helpful\r\nin some shopping environments, it is still not clear whether these technologies are\r\nmore effective than text-only instant chatting. The vividness and sensory depth of\r\nWeb site interfaces and consumer experiences, encompassed in the term media\r\nrichness, is enhanced by relatively low-cost multimedia and virtual reality (VR)\r\n\r\ntechnology that is currently available, particularly text-to-speech (TTS) voice tech-\r\nnology and three-dimensional (3D) avatars. However, before justifying and imple-\r\nmenting these technologies based solely on intuition and common sense, their im-\r\npact on users’ perceptions of their communication with e-vendors deserves a\r\n\r\ncareful and detailed investigation.\r\nKiesler, Zubrow, and Moses (1985) found that when two people meet for the first\r\ntime and exchange a series of questions to become familiar with one another, those\r\nwho communicate by computer evaluate each other less favorably than those who\r\ncommunicate face to face. Computer-mediated communication feels and acts as\r\nthough the setting is more impersonal, leading to more inhibited communication\r\n\r\nbehavior. Similar arguments have been identified in computer-mediated commu-\r\nnication (CMC) literature, where the term social presence is often used to describe\r\n\r\nthe degree to which a mediated experience is perceived as real rather than medi-\r\nated (Lombard & Ditton, 1997). According to Short, Williams, and Christie (1976),\r\n\r\nvisual media involve greater social presence than verbal (audio) media, which in\r\nturn have greater social presence than written media. In the context of electronic\r\nshopping, these findings imply that the initial trust between online consumers and\r\n\r\nremote CSRs is even more difficult to nurture and develop compared with interac-\r\ntions that take place in a physical store.\r\n\r\nWould multimedia and multimodal communication interfaces make a differ-\r\nence? Could an interface with a higher level of media richness enhance consumer\r\n\r\ntrust toward a CSR? These are the questions investigated in the current study.\r\nThe next section of this article discusses the role of trust in electronic commerce\r\nand introduces the potential effects of TTS voice and animated embodiments in\r\n76 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\ncommunication interfaces (avatars); the research model and hypotheses are pre-\r\nsented thereafter. Section 3 describes the experimental design and methods used\r\n\r\nduring the data collection phase of the study, and Sections 4 and 5 summarize and\r\ndiscuss the results. Finally, Section 6 discusses the implications, limitations, and\r\nconclusions of the study, as well as suggestions for future research.\r\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH MODEL\r\n2.1. Consumer Trust\r\nIn traditional commerce, the objects of trust can be either a company (including, for\r\nexample, the working partnership between a manufacturer firm and a distributor\r\n\r\nfirm) or a salesperson (when the major means of reaching a bargain is through per-\r\nsonal selling). In studies of personal selling and sales management, the concept of\r\n\r\nrelationship quality, which to a great extent determines future sales opportunities\r\n(Crosby, Evans, & Cowles, 1990), is composed of two dimensions: (a) trust in a\r\nsalesperson (Swan & Trawick, 1988) and (b) satisfaction with a salesperson (Crosby\r\n& Stephens, 1987). Furthermore, Crosby et al. (1990) posited that consumer trust in\r\n\r\na salesperson has two components: affect, the feelings of security or insecurity as-\r\nsociated with reliance on a salesperson, and cognition, the belief that a salesperson\r\n\r\nhas both the necessary competence and sufficient motivation to be relied on reason-\r\nably. Komiak and Benbasat (2004) further refined this definition of trust by refer-\r\nring to affect as emotional trust and expanding it to encompass a customer’s feel-\r\nings about relying on an entity, while dividing the cognitive components of trust\r\n\r\ninto (a) cognitive trust in the competence of a salesperson and (b) cognitive trust in\r\nthe goodwill of a salesperson.\r\nPrior research on online consumer trust has focused primarily on consumers’\r\ntrust toward either a Web site or a company (e.g., Gefen & Straub, 2003; Hoffman,\r\nNovak, & Peralta, 1999; McKnight, Choudhury, & Kacmar, 2002). In these studies,\r\ntrust has been defined from four major perspectives: (a) a belief or a collection of\r\nbeliefs (Bhattacherjee, 2002), (b) emotional feelings (Komiak & Benbasat, 2004), (c)\r\nan intention (Mayer & Davis, 1995), and (d) a combination of these elements\r\n(McKnight et al., 2002).\r\nIn this research, the approach taken by McKnight et al. (2002) was adopted,\r\ntreating both trusting beliefs and intentions as integral components of trust. In this\r\ncontext, trusting beliefs are defined as an individual’s perception that someone or\r\nsomething they trust has attributes that may generate benefits for them. This study\r\napplies this framework specifically to interpersonal trust; that is, a customer’s\r\ntrusting beliefs toward a CSR who provides him or her with live help and compares\r\n\r\nthis trust in online environments to consumer trust toward salespeople in tradi-\r\ntional commerce.\r\n\r\nAs discussed by Bhattacherjee (2002) and McKnight et al. (2002), there are three\r\ntrust-related attributes of a CSR who is the object of trust: (a) the competence of the\r\ntrustee, designating the ability of the trustee to do what the trustor needs, (b) the\r\ntrustee’s benevolence, denoting the trustee’s care and motivation to act in the\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 77\r\n\r\ntrustor’s interests, and (c) the trustee’s integrity, encompassing the honesty of the\r\n\r\ntrustee and the reliability of his or her promises. In as much as the live help simu-\r\nlated in this study plays only a passive role of answering users’ questions on prod-\r\nuct attributes, service policies, or Web site navigation, consumer beliefs regarding\r\n\r\nthe benevolence and integrity of the CSR providing the help are less salient. There-\r\nfore, this research concentrates on consumers’ trusting beliefs about the compe-\r\ntence of the CSR. Furthermore, as users’ trusting beliefs develop and change\r\n\r\nthrough their repeated experiences beyond initial interactions with an agent (also\r\nknown as “experienced credibility;” Tseng & Fogg, 1999), this study focuses on the\r\ninitial formation of trust.\r\nIn addition to investigating cognitive trust regarding the competence of a CSR,\r\n\r\nthe study also assesses whether users’ emotional trust is influenced by different in-\r\nterface components. Previous studies have argued that affect indeed plays an im-\r\nportant role in human-computer interactions (Hudlicka, 2003). Specifically, re-\r\nsearch in social psychology has demonstrated that emotions not only directly\r\n\r\ndetermine users’ affective states but also interact with their cognitive perceptions.\r\nPositive affective states can promote heuristic processing by consumers (Clore,\r\n\r\n1994) and increase their estimates of their own level of control over their environ-\r\nments (Isen, 1993). Among the various factors that could influence users’ affective\r\n\r\nstates, this study focuses on those stimulated by hedonic interface components.\r\nThe inclusion of hedonic information—for example, animated images, appealing\r\nvisual layouts, and multimedia contents—in a hedonic information system, such as\r\nan electronic commerce Web site, can directly influence shoppers’ perceptions of\r\nenjoyment, which is considered as a more important factor to encourage use than\r\nutilitarian goals such as perceived usefulness (Van der Heijden, 2004).\r\nDeveloping from these findings, this study investigates consumer trust from\r\nboth cognitive and emotional perspectives.\r\n2.2. Trust in Computer-Mediated Communications\r\nConsidering that live help is a Web-based and mediated form of communication, the\r\n\r\ncurrent study is informed by trust-related research in the fields of computer-sup-\r\nported collaborative work and computer-mediated communication (CMC).\r\n\r\nIn the field of CMC, studies of different communication media have proposed a\r\nset of characteristics by which media can be categorized and assessed and by which\r\n\r\nthe impacts of these characteristics on users’ attitudes toward any particular me-\r\ndium can be investigated (see e.g., Daft & Lengel, 1986; Dennis & Valacich, 1999;\r\n\r\nRice, 1992; Short et al., 1976; Walther, 1992). Among these characteristics, one of the\r\nmost significant factors is modality, the capacity of a medium to convey multiple\r\ncues simultaneously, as addressed by media richness theories (Daft & Lengel, 1984)\r\nand social presence theories (Short et al., 1976).\r\n\r\nSocial scientists have long observed that interpersonal interactions involve com-\r\nmunication of both verbal and nonverbal signals. For example, a variety of research\r\n\r\nhas demonstrated that nonverbal cues, such as expressiveness in someone’s eyes,\r\nspeech hesitations, gestures, clothing, and posture, are found to influence selected\r\n78 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\ndimensions of buyers’ initial perceptions of a salesperson and their evaluations of a\r\nvideotaped sales presentation (Leigh & Summers, 2002). Consumers’ impressions\r\nof the nonverbal cues from a CSR can thus make a significant difference in their\r\n\r\nevaluation of the CSR, especially during a first-time encounter when no past expe-\r\nrience or third-party testimonies can be consulted.\r\n\r\nThe absence of nonverbal social cues in CMC can simultaneously exert a consid-\r\nerable impact on consumer perceptions of communication quality, according to\r\n\r\nother CMC research (e.g., Bordia, 1997), in as much as social cues can foster more\r\n\r\npositive impressions than can be conveyed through more stark media. Some stud-\r\nies have suggested that depersonalized forms of communication may lead to psy-\r\nchological distance, which in turn may affect the disposition of the impressions\r\n\r\nthus formed (Rutter, 1987).\r\nIn delivering messages and associated cues toward meaning, some researchers\r\n\r\nhave found that interpersonal trust is likely to be affected by the media and modal-\r\nity used for communication. For example, Bos, Olson, Gergle, Olson, and Wright\r\n\r\n(2002) studied the emergence of trust in four different communication situations:\r\nface to face, video, audio, and text chat. They found that the first three (i.e., richer)\r\n\r\nconditions were significantly more effective than text chatting. The video and au-\r\ndio conferencing test participant group exhibited almost as many positive effects as\r\n\r\nthe face-to-face participants. Similarly, Greenspan, Goldberg, Weimer, and Basso\r\n\r\n(2000) used a controlled experiment to study prospective homebuyers who se-\r\nlected houses using the Web, telephone, and PhoneChannel interfaces (combining\r\n\r\ntelephones and televisions). Their results demonstrated that telephones and the\r\nPhoneChannel can lead to higher levels of trust. E.-J. Lee, Lee, and Schumann\r\n(2002) demonstrated that conversational information (communicated through\r\nface-to-face or telephone interactions) is perceived to be more useful than written\r\ninformation when customers are learning about innovations.\r\nIn online environments, the most prevalent communication modality is text.\r\n\r\nE-mail, instant messaging, and discussion forums have been widely used to facili-\r\ntate communication between online shoppers and vendors. Although voice chan-\r\nnels, such as vendor-supported “1-800” telephone numbers and Internet calls\r\n\r\nthrough VoIP, also are available through some Web sites, most small- and me-\r\ndium-sized vendors cannot afford dedicated call centers and service staff.\r\n\r\nReal-time video conferencing is even rarer. Besides the technical constraints, such\r\nas transmission bandwidth and video compression, the other concern of live help\r\nproviders is that the provision of audio and video output makes a CSR unable to\r\n\r\nmultitask. With text messaging, a CSR can interact with several shoppers simulta-\r\nneously, which significantly reduces the running cost while maintaining satisfac-\r\ntory response latency.\r\n\r\n2.3. TTS Voice\r\n\r\nThe first independent variable investigated in this study was the mode of informa-\r\ntion presentation applied in live help. In particular, the different modes examined\r\n\r\nwere text, speech by a TTS synthesizer, and their combination. A TTS synthesizer is\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 79\r\n\r\na computer-based system designed to read text aloud (Dutoit, 1997). The funda-\r\nmental difference between a TTS system and any other talking machine (e.g. a cas-\r\nsette player) is the ability of the former to automatically produce new sentences. In\r\n\r\nother words, the TTS system does not simply use concatenations of isolated words\r\nor parts of sentences, but rather it automatically produces speech through a\r\ngrapheme-to-phoneme transcription of sentences (Dutoit, 1997).\r\n\r\nCompared with prerecorded human speech, TTS systems are highly flexible, be-\r\ncause speech is generated on the fly, and the systems “produce” almost infinitive\r\n\r\narrays of contents. Previous successful applications of these systems on various\r\n\r\nWeb sites have provided information access, customer-ordering functions, infor-\r\nmation for drivers, and interfaces for disabled users. They are implemented widely\r\n\r\nin the area of automated voice response services, interactive voice response sys-\r\ntems, computer games, intelligent agents, and VR environments.\r\n\r\nConversely, the TTS voice systems currently available still have some intrinsic\r\ndeficiencies, because they lack the quality and prosody of natural human speech. A\r\n\r\ncomparative study (Beutnagel, Conkie, Schroeter, Stylianou, & Syrdal, 1999) dem-\r\nonstrated that the current TTS systems perform fairly successfully in terms of intel-\r\nligibility, but they are still not satisfactory in their level of naturalness. Com-\r\nputer-generated voices tend to have unnatural pauses, accents, and word\r\n\r\nemphases, as well as discontinuities between phonemes and syllables (Nass & Lee,\r\n2001). Even with the best TTS synthesizers on the market, such as AT&T’s Natural\r\n\r\nVoices, it is still quite easy for users to distinguish the synthesizer from the low-\r\nest-fidelity presentation of human speech.\r\n\r\nSomeresearchhasbeenconductedtoexploreconsumerresponsestosuch“unnat-\r\nural” machine voices. Among them, a series of studies (E.-J. Lee, Nass, & Brave, 2000;\r\n\r\nK. Lee & Nass, 2003; Nass & Lee, 2000, 2001) have investigated whether participants\r\nwould attribute social responses to computer-generated voices and found that users\r\n\r\nuse social cues even when they know that the voice speaking to them does not origi-\r\nnate from a real person. For example, when the perceived personality traits of a com-\r\nputer voice match those of the users’, the voice is generally regarded as more attrac-\r\ntive, credible, and informative than those “mismatch” ones; even the products\r\n\r\npresented by a “match” computer voice are evaluated more positively than the ones\r\nintroduced by a “mismatch” TTS voice (K. Lee & Nass, 2003; Nass & Lee, 2001).\r\n\r\nJensen, Farnham, Drucker, and Kollock (2000), after comparing four forms of com-\r\nmunication,foundthatTTSvoiceapplicationsareperceivedsignificantlymoreposi-\r\ntively than text-only interactions, contrary to their predictions that TTS voice tech-\r\nnology might lack cues that people use in predicting the veracity of utterances.\r\n\r\n2.4. Animated Embodiment and 3D Avatars\r\n\r\nThe second independent variable in live help interfaces is the use of animated em-\r\nbodiments (implemented with 3D avatars) to represent CSRs during the course of\r\n\r\ncommunication. The term avatar refers to a 2D or 3D virtual image that symbolizes\r\n\r\nthe users and the CSRs. Two issues are of primary importance to the successful im-\r\nplementation of an avatar: function and representation.\r\n\r\n80 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\nIn terms of their functionality, avatars have been used in collaborative virtual en-\r\nvironments to represent users’ presence, orientation, and location. Salem and Earle\r\n\r\n(2000) proposed that avatars also could be used to facilitate communications be-\r\ntween users. In this study, the avatar integrated in an online shopping Web site was\r\n\r\nused to represent the image of a CSR.\r\nAccording to Salem and Earle (2000, p. 94), avatars can be realistic, abstract, or\r\nnaturalistic in the form of their representation:\r\n• Realistic avatars are designed to provide accurate representations of users, for\r\nexample, real-time video images captured by a video camera may be used as the\r\nface of an avatar. However, this implementation is constrained by certain technical\r\nfactors, such as network bandwidth and computational power of users’ computers.\r\n\r\n• Abstract avatars use cartoon images or fictitious entities, for example an ani-\r\nmated talking dog or even a paper clip. Although these implementations have long\r\n\r\nbeen used in software-powered interface agents, notably in Microsoft Office, their\r\n\r\neffectiveness in supporting human-to-human communication has not been dem-\r\nonstrated empirically.\r\n\r\n• Naturalistic avatars are usually humanoid in form, but with a degraded level\r\nof detail. This type of avatar can emulate natural protocols just enough to achieve\r\nrecognition of familiar features, like a smile, a waving hand, and a nodding head.\r\nThis type of avatar was chosen not only because it is technically feasible, both in\r\nthis study and in the context of the current constraints of Internet connectivity\r\n\r\nfaced by most consumers, but also because it preserves the multimodal communi-\r\ncation and conventional conversational habits of face-to-face interaction. The use\r\n\r\nof nonverbal communication capabilities, facial ex<x>pressions, hand gestures, and\r\nbody postures can be perceived and understood easily by consumers while at the\r\nsame time enriching their interactive experiences.\r\n2.5. Hypotheses\r\n\r\nCompared with face-to-face conversation, electronically mediated forms of com-\r\nmunication, including telephony, video telephony, instant messaging, and e-mail,\r\n\r\nprovide less feedback to people who are speaking and fewer sensory cues to people\r\nlistening. With the addition of TTS voice and 3D avatars, consumers are exposed to\r\nmore audio–visual communication cues. Furthermore, when a user interacts with a\r\n\r\nhuman-like virtual character that talks and moves in a vividly simulated audio–vi-\r\nsual environment, more sensory cues are involved and perceived. On the basis of\r\n\r\nprevious research on social presence, it is expected that higher levels of vividness,\r\ndetermined by the number of sensory channels that a medium appeals to (Short et\r\nal., 1976) and the quality of the medium’s sensory fidelity (Reeves & Nass, 1996),\r\n\r\nenhance the degree to which senses are engaged, consequently increasing per-\r\nceived levels of social presence, which is defined as the extent to which an individ-\r\nual psychologically perceives other people to be physically present when interact-\r\ning with them (Short et al., 1976). Gefen and Straub (2003) demonstrated that social\r\n\r\npresence can affect consumer trust. Hence, for shoppers who lack product exper-\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 81\r\n\r\ntise or experiences of interacting with a CSR, it is very likely that a greater degree of\r\nsocial presence would permit higher levels of trust toward a CSR.\r\nSpeech carries much richer information than the literal meaning of the content of\r\nthe words that are spoken. For example, as Scherer (2003) observed, voice is as\r\n\r\ngood as facial ex<x>pressions to convey emotions. People also can perceive social sta-\r\ntus, personality, and attitudes in others’ speech style (Giles & Powesland, 1975). Al-\r\nthough the AT&T Natural Voices TTS system used in this study is still far from sat-\r\nisfactory in its degree of naturalness compared with a real human voice, it can\r\n\r\nconvey some prosodic features, such as intonation and phrasing, by selecting units\r\nfrom a large speech inventory that best matches the prosody predicted by the TTS\r\nsystem (Jilka, Syrdal, Conkie, & Kapilow, 2003). Therefore, it is posited that when\r\nlive help information is presented with TTS voice, a CSR will be perceived as more\r\ntrustworthy than when only textual information is used.\r\n\r\nConversely, when audio output and textual output are presented simulta-\r\nneously, the redundant information from both channels may render one of them\r\n\r\nless salient, as well as causing distraction and information overload. In most cur-\r\nrent text-based instant messaging protocols, each unit of “chatting message” is\r\n\r\ntransferred only when a user clicks the “send” button; as a consequence, the whole\r\nblock of the message is displayed on the receiving party’s computer screen almost\r\ninstantly. In comparison, even though TTS voice is generated on the client side,\r\nwhich means no delay is caused by the encoding/transferring/decoding process\r\nof audio signals, the playback of audio output still takes more time than the display\r\nof textual information on the monitor. In other words, when both text and voice are\r\nprovided, it will be more immediate for users to read the text on the monitor than to\r\nlisten to the same content through an audio channel. Therefore, the delayed audio\r\noutput, as well as the potential social cues embedded in it, might be largely ignored\r\n\r\nand considered to be redundant. For this reason, it is anticipated that live help in-\r\nformation presented with TTS voice only would make the CSR more trustworthy\r\n\r\nthan when both textual and audible output are presented.\r\n\r\nBased on this discussion, it is expected that live help in a “TTS voice only” condi-\r\ntion will lead to higher cognitive trust and emotional trust than both “text only”\r\n\r\nand “TTS voice + text” conditions. Because the goal of this study was to identify the\r\nbest practices for TTS implementation, interest is not in the comparison between\r\nthe “text only” and “TTS voice + text” conditions, because both are expected to be\r\ninferior to “TTS voice only.”\r\nH1a: Live help presented with “TTS voice only” will lead to a higher level of\r\ncognitive trust in the CSR than Live Help with “text only.”\r\nH1b: Live help presented with “TTS voice only” will lead to a higher level\r\nof emotional trust in the CSR than live help with “text only.”\r\nH2a: Live help presented with “TTS voice only” will lead to a higher level\r\nof cognitive trust in the CSR than live help with “TTS voice + text.”\r\nH2b: Live help presented with “TTS voice only” will lead to a higher level\r\nof emotional trust in the CSR than live help with “TTS voice + text.”\r\nIn a physical store, when a consumer talks with a salesperson for the first time,\r\nthat person judges the serviceperson’s expertise and trustworthiness not only\r\n82 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\nbased on the content of the communication but also influenced by other peripheral\r\ncues such as the salesperson’s physical attractiveness, age, and interaction style.\r\nResearch in marketing has found that heightened physical attractiveness generally\r\n\r\nenhances one’s effectiveness as a social influence agent (Chaiken, 1981); particu-\r\nlarly attractive faces are found to be effective in improving people’s responses to\r\n\r\nadvertisements (Baker & Churchill Jr., 1977). These findings coincide with an argu-\r\nment raised by Tseng and Fogg (1999) that people often believe someone or some-\r\nthing based on “surface credibility,” determined by simple inspections of the per-\r\nson or thing. One study into the effects of static images of human beings\r\n\r\n(Riegelsberger, Sasse, & McCarthy, 2003) found that photographs of staff members\r\non an e-commerce Web site can increase the perceived trustworthiness of poorly\r\nperforming vendors.\r\n\r\nThe naturalistic 3D avatar built on the Blaxxun Contact platform, although a rel-\r\natively crude and simple representation of a communicator, is able to generate sev-\r\neral common gestures, such as nodding, shaking its head, and waving its hands,\r\n\r\ntriggered automatically by the interaction content. With the provision of nonverbal\r\n\r\ncues, it is expected that the animated embodiment of the CSR will significantly in-\r\nfluence the initial formation of buyer-seller interpersonal trust.\r\n\r\nH3a: Live help interfaces with a 3D avatar will generate a higher level of cog-\r\nnitive trust in the CSR than interfaces without an avatar.\r\n\r\nH3b: Live help interfaces with a 3D avatar will generate a higher level of\r\nemotional trust in the CSR than interfaces without an avatar.\r\nIn summary, by extending the notion of interpersonal trust from traditional\r\ncommerce to the context of live help in electronic commerce, it is expected that the\r\nhuman-computer interaction interface can be a significant factor in cultivating both\r\ncognitive and emotional trust between consumers and CSRs, which will ultimately\r\ndetermine perceptions of the service quality offered by online vendors.\r\n3. RESEARCH METHODS\r\n3.1. Web Site Design\r\nFor the experiment section of this study,a3×2 factorial design was used, with\r\nthree levels for the use of voice technology and two for the use of avatars. The three\r\npossible conditions regarding TTS voice were the use of text only, the use of voice\r\nonly, and the use of text and voice together. The avatar, however, was either present\r\nor absent. Six simulated live help interfaces were thus constructed (as displayed in\r\nTable 1) and integrated with a shopping Web site designed to sell digital cameras\r\nand camera accessories. The products (digital cameras, camera memory, and photo\r\nprinters) were suitable for this study because they involved a significant amount of\r\n\r\ntechnical information, and real-time interactions are highly appreciated by custom-\r\ners who have questions about the products before committing to a purchase.\r\n\r\nThe look and feel of the interface was designed to resemble actual online shop-\r\nping Web sites as closely as possible. As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, on the left\r\n\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 83\r\n\r\nside of the screen, a list of product categories was displayed along with compo-\r\nnents typical to e-commerce Web sites. Hyperlinks for product categories led to\r\n\r\nsubcategories where products are further classified. This hierarchy continued until\r\na specific product page was displayed. Three related products (digital cameras,\r\ncamera memory, and photo printers) were used to ensure that enough interactions\r\n\r\nwould take place between each participant and a serviceperson, because most par-\r\n84 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\nTable 1: Six Types of Live Help Interfaces\r\nCondition “Live Help” Interface Features\r\n1 No avatar & text only\r\n2 No avatar & voice only\r\n3 No avatar & text + voice\r\n4 3D avatar & text only\r\n5 3D avatar & voice only\r\n6 3D avatar & text + voice\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1 Live help inter-\r\nface with text chat only.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 2 Live help inter-\r\nface with both TTS voice and\r\n\r\nan avatar.\r\n\r\nticipants would ask the serviceperson some questions about the compatibility and\r\nspecifications of these products.\r\n3.2. Implementation of Live Help\r\nWith the use of “frame” tags of HTML, the shopping site was integrated with a live\r\nhelp interface that was implemented separately, while still giving the participant\r\nthe illusion that the live help feature was part of the shopping site.\r\nTwo research assistants were recruited for the experiment. One accompanied the\r\n\r\nparticipants and guided them through the entire experiment process; the other re-\r\nmained in a separate room and used a networked computer to play the role of a\r\n\r\nCSR. This CSR assistant had been extensively trained regarding both product\r\n\r\nknowledge pertaining to digital cameras and general customer service skills. Be-\r\nfore the experiment, a Web-based product database with detailed specifications\r\n\r\nand product comparisons was prepared for the assistant to answer queries on the\r\nfly, so that the promptness and correctness of the answers could be ensured.\r\nBlaxxun Contact and its online virtual space were used to generate text chatting\r\nand to implement the 3D avatars (see Figures 1 and 2). Blaxxun Contact is a free VR\r\nmarkup language (VRML) plug-in for designing virtual communities. The Blaxxun\r\nplatform provides several forms of communication that can be easily integrated\r\nwith the experimental Web site. In this study, it was used in every condition for text\r\n\r\nchatting and for viewing and controlling a humanoid 3D avatar. In the without-av-\r\natar condition, participants were presented only two frames: the chat input frame\r\n\r\nand the chat output frame. In the with-avatar condition, an additional VRML frame\r\nwas included in which the participants observed an avatar that represented the\r\nCSR. No other avatars were visible on the computer screen. To ensure consistency,\r\n\r\nthe participants were not able to change any visual settings (such as avatar size, dis-\r\ntance, or view angles), except to edit their chat input.\r\n\r\nBody language is the most important characteristic of a 3D avatar. The Blaxxun\r\n\r\nplatform enables its avatars to exhibit several body movements that make commu-\r\nnication more interactive, including waving their hands, nodding, shaking their\r\n\r\nheads, and frowning. All of these body movements are activated by predefined\r\nkeywords in the chat text, that is, the content of the text chat message. During the\r\nexperiment, only the answers and advice given by the serviceperson could trigger\r\n\r\nthe avatar’s body movement. Commonly used emotion-conveying words (for ex-\r\nample, “Hello,” “Exactly,” and “Thank you”) were selected and matched with spe-\r\ncific avatar body movements. Figure 3 demonstrates the interface that links some\r\n\r\nkeywords with specific avatar body movements and body gestures.\r\n\r\nAT&T Natural Voices was selected as the TTS engine for the current study be-\r\ncause it is attributed with providing “the highest measured naturalness and intelli-\r\ngibility for U.S. English TTS in the world” (AT&T Web site). As a component that is\r\n\r\ncompliant with standard Speech Application Program Interfaces, it can be inte-\r\ngrated with other software to “read” designated texts. However, the Blaxxun plat-\r\nform and the AT&T TTS engine are not compatible with each other; thus, another\r\n\r\npiece of software, AT&T Instant Messenger, was employed to operate in the back-\r\nground, for duplicating message texts and reading them aloud.\r\n\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 85\r\n\r\n3.3. Measures\r\nAccording to Komiak and Benbasat (2004), cognitive trust is defined as a trustor’s\r\n\r\nrational assessment that a trustee will have the ability to fulfill its obligations as un-\r\nderstood by the trustor; emotional trust, in contrast, is defined as a trustor’s feel-\r\nings of security and comfort related to his or her reliance on a trustee. Based on card\r\n\r\nsorting and factor analysis, Komiak and Benbasat developed a comprehensive set\r\nof measurements (all 7-point Likert scale items) for both cognitive trust in a\r\ntrustee’s competence (five items) and emotional trust (five items). These measures\r\n\r\nwere used in the current study with minor adaptation (see Appendix 1 for the com-\r\nplete set of measures).\r\n\r\n3.4. Procedures\r\nSeventy-two participants (38 women and 34 men) were recruited for the experiment\r\n\r\nthrough advertisements placed on a university campus. Participants were, on aver-\r\n86 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\nFIGURE 3 Body gestures of the avatar.\r\n\r\nage, 23 years old, and most of them were university students. Their reward was $10\r\ncash, plus a one-in-ten chance to win a gift certificate valued at 50% of the price of the\r\ncamera that they selected during the experiment (up to $200). The participants were\r\nrandomly assigned to one of six interface groups. During the experiment, they were\r\nasked to buy a digital camera and related accessories as a gift for a friend. Time was\r\n\r\nnotlimited,althoughtheparticipantsgenerallyspentaround40to60minonthepur-\r\nchase process. The experimental procedures were designed as follows:\r\n\r\nTraining: After reading the information sheet about the shopping task, each par-\r\nticipant was trained by a research assistant on using and navigating the Web site in-\r\nterface and on using the live help interface. The participants did not proceed to the\r\n\r\nsecond stage until they understood how to use both interfaces.\r\nMain test: Each participant was then asked to examine and to choose a digital\r\ncamera, camera memory, and a photo printer and encouraged to use the live help\r\n\r\nfunction to interact with the CSR for any questions about the Web site or the prod-\r\nucts. After selecting the product they preferred, the participant was asked to put\r\n\r\nthe product into a shopping cart. A research assistant observed and recorded\r\nwhether the participant used the live help feature. In addition, the interaction log\r\n\r\nbetween the participant and the assistant was saved unobtrusively for further anal-\r\nysis, under the “voice only” condition, and a log file was constructed by combining\r\n\r\nthe records from both Blaxxun Contact and AT&T Instant Messenger interfaces.\r\nQuestionnaire: After completing the shopping task, each participant was asked\r\nto fill out a questionnaire with the measures of both cognitive trust and emotional\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n4. RESULTS\r\nThe data were checked for integrity and completeness before statistical tests were\r\nperformed. Reliability tests indicated that the Cronbach alpha of both dependent\r\n\r\nvariables were greater than 0.8 (the Cronbach alpha of cognitive trust and emo-\r\ntional trust are 0.92 and 0.88, respectively), suggesting that these measures are reli-\r\nable. A univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted on each de-\r\npendent variable. The descriptive statistics and ANOVA results are listed in Tables\r\n\r\n2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThe ANOVA results revealed only marginal differences among the three infor-\r\nmation presentation modes for both cognitive trust, F(2, 66) = 3.08, p < .055, and\r\n\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 87\r\n\r\nTable 2: Means and Standard Deviations for Cognitive Trust and Emotional Trust for\r\n\r\nEach of Six Live Help Interfaces\r\nWithout Avatar With Avatar\r\nText Voice Text + Voice Text Voice Text + Voice\r\nM SD M SD M SD M SD M SD M SD\r\nCognitive trust 5.42 0.94 5.65 0.83 5.32 1.31 5.10 1.35 6.22 0.56 5.43 0.80\r\nEmotional trust 4.80 1.08 5.40 0.74 4.67 1.06 4.92 1.32 5.52 1.23 4.83 1.32\r\n\r\nemotional trust, F(2, 66) = 2.679, p < .08. A post hoc analysis was conducted to fur-\r\nther examine the difference between “TTS voice only” and “text only” conditions\r\n\r\nas well as between “TTS voice only” and “text + TTS voice” conditions. Because of\r\nthe nature of multiple testing, simple pair-wise comparisons may risk inflating the\r\n\r\nnominal .05 alpha level. In other words, individual p values of the pair-wise com-\r\nparisons should be adjusted to test the actual statistical significance. For this rea-\r\nson, Holm’s procedure1 was selected to calculate the adjusted p because it is uni-\r\nformly more powerful than the Bonferroni procedure and other methods of\r\n\r\nadjustment (Aickin & Gensler, 1996). The results are listed in Table 4.\r\nThe results in Table 4 reveal that a CSR communicating through only TTS voice\r\nwas perceived as significantly more trustworthy, in terms of cognitive trust, than\r\n\r\nthe CSR that used only text (Holm-adjusted p < .02) and marginally more trustwor-\r\nthy in terms of emotional trust (Holm-adjusted p < .07). The CSR in “TTS voice\r\n\r\nonly” condition also was evaluated as more trustworthy than that in the “TTS voice\r\n+ text” condition (Holm-adjusted p < .045 for cognitive trust and Holm-adjusted p\r\n\r\n< .65 for emotional trust). In other words, the experiment participants tended to in-\r\nvest more trust in the CSR’s competence and were more likely to trust the CSR emo-\r\ntionally when the live help was presented with only TTS voice, compared with the\r\n\r\ntextual presentation or a mixture of both. Hypotheses H1a and H2a were com-\r\npletely supported whereas H1b and H2b were only marginally supported.\r\n\r\nNo significant difference was found between the avatar group and the\r\nnonavatar group, F(1, 66) = 0.265, p > .60, for cognitive trust and F(1, 66) = .245, p >\r\n.62 for emotional trust. Therefore, hypotheses H3a and H3b were not supported. In\r\n88 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\n1According to Holm (1979), the Holm’s procedure is accomplished as follows. First, the pi values are\r\nplaced in increasing order. Second, each pi is compared with a/(n – i + 1) for rejection. Third, starting\r\nwith the smallest p value, one continues applying these comparisons until the first nonrejection. The\r\nHolm’s adjusted pi equals to max [(n ≤ j ≤ 1)*pj] or 1, whichever is smaller (1 ≤ j ≤ i).\r\nTable 4: Post-Hoc Analysis of Three Voice Conditions\r\nCognitive Trust Emotional Trust\r\n\r\nComparison\r\n\r\nMean\r\nDifference\r\nPair-Wise\r\np\r\nHolm-Adjusted\r\np\r\nMean\r\nDifference\r\nPair-Wise\r\np\r\nHolm-Adjusted\r\np\r\nVoice versus Text .675 .019 .038 .600 .069 .069\r\nVoice versus Text + Voice .558 .041 .041 .708 .032 .064\r\n\r\nTable 3: ANOVA Results of 3D Avatar and TTS Voice\r\nCognitive Trust Emotional Trust\r\nFpFp\r\nAvatar .265 .608 .245 .622\r\nVoice 3.080 .053 2.679 .076\r\nAvatar * Voice 1.154 .322 .004 .996\r\n\r\naddition, no significant interaction effects were found between the two independ-\r\nent variables, F(2, 66) = 1.154, p > .32 for cognitive trust and F(2, 66) = .004, p > .99 for\r\n\r\nemotional trust.\r\n\r\n5. DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe results demonstrate that TTS voice exerts significant effects on users’ percep-\r\ntions of both their cognitive trust in a CSR’s competence and their emotional\r\n\r\ntrust in the CSRs. Consistent with the findings by Jensen et al. (2000), more im-\r\nmediate forms of communication, like TTS, exhibit a greater impact on the devel-\r\nopment of trust. Despite the fact that TTS voice is sometimes monotonous in\r\n\r\nspeed and lacks variety in its tones, it is already realistic enough to generate sig-\r\nnificant social responses, which has been demonstrated by the results of other re-\r\nsearch efforts (E.-J. Lee et al., 2000; K. Lee & Nass, 2003; Nass & Lee, 2000, 2001).\r\n\r\nIn addition, another hypothesis, that the combination of voice and text may add\r\nextra burdens to users’ cognitive efforts and decrease the perceived social cues\r\nfrom voice, has been confirmed, implying that, in the design of multimodality\r\n\r\ncommunication interfaces, it is critical to consider the potential compatibility is-\r\nsues between various channels.\r\n\r\nNo empirical support was found for assertions about the effects of animated\r\navatars on consumer trust. One apparent explanation may be that people do not\r\ncare what the virtual CSR looks like when they are looking for help; conversely,\r\nthe lack of support could be attributed to the limitations of technology. It appears\r\n\r\nthat currently available Web-based animated embodiments still lack the vivid-\r\nness and interactivity that make a strong peripheral cue to influence users’ judg-\r\nments. In this study, although the 3D avatar could generate basic body language,\r\n\r\nthe lack of facial ex<x>pressions greatly degraded the fidelity and warmness one\r\n\r\nmight perceive in face-to-face communication. Further, the voice and body move-\r\nment of the avatar were not perfectly synchronized with each other. Additional\r\n\r\nstudies need to be conducted to test whether the perception of trust can be signif-\r\nicantly enhanced when a more vivid avatar with facial ex<x>pressions and better\r\n\r\nsynchronization is presented.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that some of the significant results have arisen due to novelty ef-\r\nfects, because none of the participants in the TTS or avatar groups had experienced\r\n\r\nsuch live help interfaces in their past online shopping experiences. Although the\r\nnovelty effects may diminish as participants become more accustomed to live help\r\nfunctionality and its interfaces, the impact of interface factors on the formation of\r\ninitial consumer trust should not be underestimated, especially for those pure-play\r\nonline vendors who cannot establish their initial reputations through\r\nbrick-and-mortar stores or other physical presentations. As shoppers build up their\r\ntrusting beliefs through repeated purchase or interaction experiences, “experience\r\ncredibility” (Tseng & Fogg, 1999) will play a more influential role.\r\nAs the prevalence of broadband connections increases average connection\r\nspeeds, other candidate technologies, such as using real human speech through\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 89\r\n\r\nVoIP or employing online video images captured by a Web cam, will become more\r\n\r\ntechnologically feasible for Live Help services. Technological advances can pro-\r\nvide a communication medium with higher fidelity; however, the lack of support\r\n\r\nfor multitasking will ensure that TTS voice and 3D avatars remain competitive op-\r\ntions in the near future.\r\n\r\n6. SUMMARY\r\nThis article provides new empirical data for the application of the media richness\r\nand social presence theories, as discussed in Section 2, to Web site interfaces and\r\n\r\nvirtual communication design in online shopping environments. With the empha-\r\nses on both cognitive and emotional aspects of consumer trust, these findings com-\r\nplement the results from a relevant study by Qiu and Benbasat (2004), which found\r\n\r\nthat the presence of TTS voice significantly increases consumers’ perceptions of\r\n\r\nflow (a construct depicting a user’s interaction with a computer as playful and ex-\r\nploratory) and that 3D avatars enhance consumers’ feelings of telepresence (a\r\n\r\nuser’s experience of appearing to be present in a remote environment by means of a\r\n\r\ncommunication medium). As this study demonstrated, building on previous re-\r\nsearch, multimedia and multimodal interface components and communication\r\n\r\nmedia have the potential to exert significant influences on the formation of initial\r\ntrust between online shoppers and distant CSRs.\r\n\r\nThe results from this study provide several important implications for practitio-\r\nners in evaluating and designing live help interface features. As mentioned in a re-\r\nport in The Wall Street Journal (Wingfield, 2002), although consumers generally en-\r\njoy the convenience of online shopping, long-distance purchases made without\r\n\r\nhuman contact still make them cautious before putting things into their shopping\r\n\r\ncarts. When a communication interface is rich in expressiveness and closely emu-\r\nlates real face-to-face interactions, a Web merchant will be able to enhance its per-\r\nceived trustworthiness in the eyes of online consumers. This implies that the extra\r\n\r\ncosts of implementing multimedia technologies are justifiable based on the im-\r\nprovement of the merchant’s reputation and correlated increases in the Web site’s\r\n\r\nconversion rate.2 These results also could be used by Customer Relationship Man-\r\nagement software vendors in designing real-time customer-support tools.\r\n\r\nSeveral limitations should be pointed out. Although the laboratory experiment\r\n\r\ncould maintain strict controls over possible confounding variables, the lack of a real-\r\nistic setting and environment may limit its ecological validity. From an experimental\r\n\r\ndesign point of view, the limited sample size employed in this study could pose a se-\r\nrious threat to the application of these findings, indicating that the full set of differ-\r\nences between treatments may be difficult to identify. Similar previous studies have\r\n\r\ndemonstrated that the magnitude of effects of these technologies is usually either\r\n\r\nlow or medium; therefore, additional data should be gathered in future studies to as-\r\n90 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\n2A conversion rate is a metric defined as the number of visitors who make a purchase directly from\r\nthe Web site as a percentage of total visitors.\r\n\r\ncertain whether statistically significant effects would emerge. In addition, the use of\r\n\r\nstudent participants to some extent limits the external validity and general applica-\r\nbility of the results. Users’ personal traits may have some interaction effects with the\r\n\r\nresults. For example, an individual’s level of extroversion might affect whether he or\r\nshe would like to use the live help function to interact with others during shopping\r\nand the ease with which a feeling of emotional trust is developed.\r\n\r\nIn this study, no evidence has been found that the 3D avatar used could signifi-\r\ncantly enhance consumer trust on either cognitive or emotional dimensions. Some\r\n\r\nresearchers have argued that human-like systems may induce users to form false\r\nmental models of the system and typically too high expectations about the system’s\r\nbehavior in cognitive and emotional aspects (Shneiderman & Maes, 1997; Norman,\r\n1994). Should the avatar be designed with a simple and naturalistic look, or should\r\n\r\nit be made as realistic as possible? What type of avatars would be preferred by us-\r\ners: two-dimensional talking-heads or three-dimensional full bodies? Additional\r\n\r\nexploratory studies should be conducted to investigate users’ responses to various\r\navatar designs.\r\n\r\nAs a potentially generalizable application in studies of human-computer inter-\r\naction and online consumer behavior, the design of live help interfaces has been in-\r\nvestigated in this article. The results of this study build the foundation for answer-\r\ning other important questions: How might mediating variables such as feelings of\r\n\r\ntrust affect users’ purchasing decisions? Does a media-rich live help interface in-\r\ncrease the likelihood that users will make repeated visits in the future? Research\r\n\r\nalong these lines is needed to comprehend the full set of potential benefits of TTS\r\nand avatar interface technologies.');

Thus, the current study analyzed presence, self-\r\nreported anxiety, and a physiological parameter (heart rate [HR]) in a sample of 30 high anxious and 35 low\r\n\r\nanxious participants. Both groups delivered a 5 minute speech in a virtual lecture hall. Results indicate no\r\nmediating influences of presence on group differences in self-reported state anxiety during the speech, but point\r\ntoward negative correlations between state anxiety and the iGroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) scales ‘‘sense\r\nof being there’’ and ‘‘realism.’’ Furthermore, HR was found to be unrelated to self-reported presence. Only the\r\nIPQ scale ‘‘spatial presence’’ showed a marginally significant influence on group differences in state anxiety.\r\nThe present results support the assumption that presence and anxiety are logically distinct, meaning that presence\r\ndoes not directly influence the intensity of an emotion felt in a VE. Rather, it constitutes a precondition for an\r\nemotion to be at all elicited by a VE. Also, HR has proven to be no adequate substitute measure for presence,\r\nsince it only assesses anxiety not presence. It may, however, mediate the interplay between trait anxiety and state\r\nanxiety. Possible implications of the current findings are discussed alongside the problem of using presence\r\nquestionnaires that seem to be prone to subjective bias (i.e., participants confusing presence and emotion).\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nFor virtual exposure to be an effective therapeutic\r\ntool, sufficient levels of subjectively perceived anxiety\r\nand physiological arousal are necessary.1 Both, however, are\r\nbelieved to be attained only if the person is actually present in\r\nthe virtual environment (VE). This experience of being there\r\nin an artificially created environment is commonly defined as\r\nthe ‘‘perceptional illusion of non-mediation,’’2 or, in other\r\nwords, as a disregard of the technology’s mediating role in\r\nthe creation of an environment. Hence, a person who is\r\nsubject to this illusion reacts to an artificial environment as\r\nif it was real,3 and may therefore experience the same level of\r\nanxiety as in a comparable physical environment. Despite\r\nthis theoretical reasoning, the empirical relationship between\r\npresence and anxiety is still far from being understood.4\r\nResearch to date has produced mixed findings, which on the\r\none hand may be attributable to cross-study differences in\r\n\r\nused methodologies, but on the other hand may also trace\r\nback to disagreements concerning the theoretical basis of this\r\n\r\nlink. Considering this, the current study aimed at investi-\r\ngating the relationship between anxiety and presence in stu-\r\ndents with social anxiety using a virtual lecture hall.\r\n\r\nSelf-reported anxiety\r\n\r\nThe link between presence and emotions has been iden-\r\ntified as a critical topic for examination,5 and has resulted in\r\n\r\na lively scientific debate in the past decade.6–12 This debate\r\n\r\nhas mainly evolved around the question about the relation-\r\nship’s direction, that is, whether an emotion increases the\r\n\r\nsense of presence, or whether presence enhances an emotion,\r\n\r\nor whether, after all, they interact with each other recipro-\r\ncally.7,10 Some studies have found positive correlations be-\r\ntween presence and self-reported anxiety,4,10,13,14 while\r\n\r\nothers have failed to find any connections.1,15,16 Most of\r\n\r\n1\r\nDepartment of Applied Psychology: Health, Development, Enhancement and Intervention, Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna,\r\nVienna, Austria. 2\r\nResearch Group Entertainment Computing, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\r\n3\r\nDepartment of Sociology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\r\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\r\nCYBERPSYCHOLOGY, BEHAVIOR, AND SOCIAL NETWORKING\r\nVolume 17, Number 5, 2014\r\na Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\r\nDOI: 10.1089/cyber.2013.0472\r\n\r\n310\r\n\r\nthese studies, however, have methodological limitations:\r\nthey evaluate small samples16 with no controls,4 or use\r\n\r\nsingle-item measures of presence or anxiety instead of val-\r\nidated questionnaires,7,10,16 or they present these single-item\r\n\r\nmeasures concomitantly,7,10 thus inflating statistical corre-\r\nlations. Also, they seem to follow the presupposition that the\r\n\r\nmore presence a person experiences, the more anxiety he/she\r\nwill report in an anxiety inducing VE, or, conversely, the\r\nmore anxiety the person feels, the more presence he/she will\r\nreport. Accordingly, in some studies, highly anxious subjects\r\nwere reported to experience more presence in an anxiety\r\ninducing environment than nonanxious controls.13,14,16\r\nSome scholars,8,10 however, criticize that these positive\r\n\r\ncorrelations may simply be caused by the fact that respon-\r\ndents confuse emotion with presence (i.e., ‘‘I am more\r\n\r\nanxious, therefore I must be more present’’10).\r\nNaturally, this would contradict the above mentioned\r\ndefinition of presence. There, a higher level of presence does\r\n\r\nnot equal a more intense emotion; it rather reflects a con-\r\ncordance between the emotion experienced in a VE and an\r\n\r\nemotion experienced in a comparable real life situation.11,12\r\nThis is in line with Slater12 who states that ‘‘it is wrong to\r\nassume that high presence always implies strong emotion.’’\r\nThus, presence may be rather thought of as a gateway to\r\nemotion: there must be a certain amount of presence to be at\r\nall able to feel the emotion the VE is meant to elicit. Yet, the\r\nintensity of the emotion is not directly dependent on presence\r\nbut rather on the interplay between personal characteristic\r\n(e.g., high trait anxiety) and the VE’s (emotional) content.\r\nConsidering the above stated premises, presence is—at\r\nmost—expected to mediate the relationship between trait and\r\n\r\nstate anxiety (following the presence as a gateway hypo-\r\nthesis). Yet, it is not anticipated to be directly correlated to\r\n\r\nthe intensity of anxiety felt in a VE.12\r\nHeart rate measures\r\nGiven that self-reported presence questionnaires seem to\r\nbe prone to bias, corroborative physiological measures such\r\nas heart rate (HR) have been suggested to be used alongside\r\nsubjective measures of presence.5,17 Logically, these two\r\nmeasures should correlate if they target the same construct.8\r\n\r\nOne could argue that if HR (or any other physiological in-\r\ndicator) should ever serve as an alternative indicator of\r\n\r\npresence, it should somehow be related to what participants\r\nsubjectively report about their sense of being in the VE.\r\nDespite this requirement, only a very small number of\r\n\r\nstudies16,18–21—in contrast to a vast majority22–28—has ac-\r\ntually statistically correlated presence and physiological\r\n\r\nmeasures, and only one study19 found a significant positive\r\ncorrelation between presence and change in HR.\r\nHowever, from a theoretical point of view, an increase in\r\nHR—similar to self-reported anxiety—cannot be expected to\r\ngo hand in hand with an analogous increase in presence,\r\nsince an increase in HR merely reflects higher levels of\r\nanxiety, not presence.7 Considering this, presence may again\r\nbe understood as a gateway: it enables the physiological\r\nreaction but does not directly influence its intensity. In this\r\n\r\nsense, it is only a question of whether the physiological re-\r\naction in a VE matches the reaction that is expected in\r\n\r\nsimilar real life circumstances (see similarity paradigm8\r\n).\r\n\r\nStudies23,29 comparing nonanxious subjects to anxious sub-\r\njects in stressful VEs found that the latter group exhibited\r\n\r\nhigher physiological arousal, as they would do expectedly in\r\n\r\na comparable physical environment. This result was inter-\r\npreted as indirect evidence for presence, since participants\r\n\r\nreacted to the VE as they would have done in a comparable\r\nphysical environment.\r\nGiven these contradicting assumptions, more research is\r\nwarranted directly correlating presence and HR to assess\r\nconvergent validity and to test whether HR could at all be\r\nused as a corroborative measure of self-reported presence.\r\nFurthermore, studies are needed to evaluate the claim that\r\npresence acts as a gateway to a physiological reaction, thus\r\nmediating the interplay between participants’ trait anxiety\r\nand their subjectively perceived state anxiety in a VE.\r\nAim of study\r\nIn this study, presence shall on the one hand be introduced\r\n\r\nas a covariate to test for its mediating influence on differ-\r\nences between highly anxious and low anxious participants\r\n\r\nregarding their anxiety reaction (self-reported and HR) when\r\nholding a speech in front of a virtual audience. Additionally,\r\n\r\nintercorrelations between anxiety and presence shall be as-\r\nsessed to reinforce Slater’s12 claim and to test for convergent\r\n\r\nvalidity. Thus, three main research questions (RQ) can be\r\nstated for the current study:\r\nRQ1: Are there differences between high anxiety and low\r\nanxiety participants in self-reported anxiety when accounting\r\nfor influences of presence?\r\nRQ2: Are there differences between high anxiety and low\r\nanxiety participants in HR measurements when accounting\r\nfor influences of presence?\r\nRQ3: Are there intercorrelations between presence, HR, and\r\nself-reported anxiety?\r\nMethods\r\nAll participants were recruited via university courses, and\r\n\r\nreceived credits for their participation. The study was con-\r\nducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and thus a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive informed consent was provided to all par-\r\nticipants prior to their participation.\r\n\r\nParticipants\r\nThe sample consisted of 65 German speaking students.\r\nParticipants with a score q35 on the Social Interaction\r\nAnxiety Scale (SIAS30; see measures) were assigned to the\r\nhigh anxious group, whereas students with scores below this\r\ncutoff formed the low anxious group. Hence, 30 participants\r\nreported high levels of social anxiety (2 males, 28 females;\r\nage: M = 22.97, SD = 2.512), and 35 showed low social\r\nanxiety (7 males, 28 females; age: M = 24.46, SD = 2.924).\r\nNo participant reported a clinically relevant history of a\r\nsocial anxiety disorder. All participants had corrected to\r\n\r\nnormal eye sight and reported no prior experience with ex-\r\nperimental VEs. Further exclusion criteria were existing\r\n\r\nheart diseases or a history of psychiatric disorders, as well as\r\npsychiatric medication and medication influencing blood\r\npressure. The majority of participants in both groups (75.4%)\r\nreported to have a lot of computer experience, compared to\r\nPRESENCE AND ANXIETY 311\r\n\r\nonly 24.6% of participants who indicated to have only little\r\ncomputer experience. There was no difference between the\r\ntwo groups, v2\r\n\r\n(1) = 0.871, p = 0.397.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\nAfter signing the informed consent form, participants were\r\nled to a quiet room to fill out a demographic survey and\r\n\r\npsychological questionnaires. Upon completion of the pre-\r\nassessment, participants were instructed to deliver a 5 minute\r\n\r\nspeech in front of a virtual audience. For this purpose, they\r\n\r\nwere provided with a printed version of the 20 slide pre-\r\nsentation and asked to get acquainted with it during a 5\r\n\r\nminute preparation period. The number of 20 slides was\r\nchosen to guarantee the participants would not finish the\r\npresentation before the 5 minute period ended.\r\nFurthermore, a fairly original theme (Bhutan’s geography\r\nand governmental form) was selected to ensure the subject’s\r\nnovelty. After the preparation period, the electrocardiogram\r\n(ECG) was attached, and the participant was asked to rest for\r\n1 minute. This relaxation phase constituted the baseline for\r\nthe subsequent ECG measurements. Then, the participants\r\nwere shown how to flip the virtual presentation slides using\r\n\r\nthe F710 Wireless Gamepad (Logitech Europe S.A., Swit-\r\nzerland), and the head mounted display (eMagin Z800 3D;\r\n\r\nBellevue, WA) with an integrated head tracking unit (360-\r\nhorizontal, >60-\r\nvertical), and two stereoscopic SVGA\r\n\r\nOLED displays (resolution: 800 · 600 triad pixels) were\r\ndonned. The experimenter took a seat behind a screen from\r\nwhere he/she could control the simulation and observe the\r\n\r\nphysiological measurements without being seen by the par-\r\nticipants. When the simulation ended, the participants were\r\n\r\nagain led to the assessment room to fill out the remaining\r\nquestionnaires.\r\nVirtual public speaking scenario\r\nThe virtual public speaking scenario was modeled after a\r\ntypical university lecture hall using Visual Studio C + +\r\nExpress as well as the Ogre3d (www.ogre3d.org/) graphics\r\nengine in combination with QuickGUI. The textures were\r\n\r\nprocessed with GIMP (www.gimp.org/), and real time ren-\r\ndering was achieved with Blender 3D (www.blender.org/). A\r\n\r\nstandardized protocol was applied for the experiment, re-\r\nsulting in both a constant number of 20 male and female\r\n\r\nvirtual characters in the audience and a constant distribution\r\nof emotions among the virtual listeners. Half of the virtual\r\ncharacters displayed a neutral ex<x>pression, whereas four\r\n\r\ncharacters had a slight frown and four smiled. Two charac-\r\nters who were seemingly bored rested their heads on the table\r\n\r\n(see Fig. 1).\r\nAdditionally, the virtual room was filled with the sound of\r\na quiet murmur, which, at times, was interrupted by a slight\r\ncough. During the whole presentation, participants—\r\nrepresented by their first person view avatars—were standing\r\non a podium with a display of the slides in front of them.\r\nThey could turn their heads but could not move freely around\r\nthe hall.\r\nMeasures\r\n\r\nBoth psychological self-report questionnaires and physi-\r\nological measures were applied alongside a short demo-\r\ngraphic survey.\r\n\r\nParticipant selection. In order to assign participants to\r\nthe high anxious or the low anxious group, the SIAS30 was\r\napplied. It assesses the trait component of interaction anxiety\r\nusing 20 items (e.g., ‘‘I have difficulty talking with other\r\n\r\npeople’’) on a 4-point Likert scale (‘‘not at all’’ to ‘‘ex-\r\ntremely’’). This scale was used to avoid a participant’s ten-\r\ndency to choose the rather uninformative, neutral middle\r\n\r\ncategory, and to allow for a better discrimination between the\r\ntwo groups. In the current study, the internal consistency was\r\nsatisfactory (Cronbach’s a = 0.87), and a cutoff value of q35\r\nwas used for group assignments.\r\nSelf-reported anxiety. Participants were asked to rate\r\ntheir level of situational anxiety prior to and shortly after\r\nholding the presentation on the 20-item state version (Form\r\nX1) of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI31). The\r\nitems (e.g., ‘‘I am nervous’’) were answered on a 4-point\r\nLikert scale (‘‘very’’ to ‘‘not at all’’). Internal consistency\r\nwas very high, with a = 0.89 for pre-assessment and a = 0.93\r\nfor post assessment.\r\nPresence. The German version of the iGroup Presence\r\nQuestionnaire (IPQ32) was applied immediately after the\r\nexposure in order to assess the level of presence experienced\r\nin the virtual lecture hall. The IPQ comprises 14 items on a 7-\r\npoint Likert scale (‘‘strongly agree’’ to ‘‘strongly disagree’’),\r\nwhich add up to three scales: (a) ‘‘spatial presence’’ assesses\r\n\r\nthe physical sense of actually being in the virtual environ-\r\nment (e.g., ‘‘I felt present in the virtual space’’); (b) ‘‘in-\r\nvolvement’’ evaluates the amount of attention focused on the\r\n\r\nvirtual stimuli (e.g., ‘‘I was completely captivated by the\r\nvirtual world’’); and (c) ‘‘realism’’ reflects the participant’s\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. Participants’ view\r\nof the virtual lecture hall\r\nfrom the front and when\r\nturning the head to the left.\r\n312 FELNHOFER ET AL.\r\n\r\nperception of the virtual environment as real and believable\r\n(e.g., ‘‘The virtual world seemed more realistic than the real\r\nworld’’). An additional single item—‘‘sense of being there’’\r\n(‘‘In the computer generated world I had a sense of ‘being\r\nthere’ ’’)—assesses the experience of perceiving the virtual\r\nsimulation as a place that has been visited. In the present\r\nstudy, the scales’ internal consistencies were comparable to\r\nthose found in previous studies33: ‘‘spatial presence’’ (a =\r\n0.77), ‘‘involvement’’ (a = 0.82), and ‘‘realism’’ (a = 0.76).\r\nPsychophysiological measures. HR was selected as a\r\n\r\nmeasure of the participants’ stress-related sympathetic ac-\r\ntivity. It was recorded via M-EXG (Schuhfried BFB 2000\r\n\r\nx-pert; Moedling, Austria) using three one-way electrodes\r\n(3M Medica RedDot electrodes; Perchtoldsdorf, Austria) of\r\nwhich two were positioned on the chest and one on the neck\r\n(reference). HR was monitored at 5 millisecond intervals\r\nthroughout the speech; 60 second intervals were computed\r\nusing the Kubios HRV software (Biosignal Analysis and\r\n\r\nMedical Imaging Group, Kuopio, Finland) for further anal-\r\nysis. High HR values (beats per minute) indicate high\r\n\r\nphysiological arousal, whereas low HR values represent\r\nlower physiological stress.\r\nResults\r\nStatistical analyses were carried out using SPSS v19\r\n(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL), considering a significance\r\n\r\nthreshold of p < 0.05. There were no differences regard-\r\ning the baseline levels of HR measures (T49.5 = - 1.654,\r\n\r\np = 0.104), but as expected, anxious individuals reported\r\n\r\nhigher levels of self-reported anxiety (T63 = - 4.706, p <\r\n0.001) before the virtual public speaking task. Additionally,\r\nno significant differences could be found between high and\r\nlow anxious participants concerning their level of presence\r\n\r\nduring the virtual public speaking task (see Table 1). Fur-\r\nthermore, Table 2 shows intercorrelations of HR and state\r\n\r\nanxiety with the IPQ subscales. Only the scales ‘‘sense of\r\nbeing there’’ (r = - 0.306) and ‘‘realism’’ (r = - 0.280)\r\nshowed a significant negative correlation with the STAI after\r\nthe presentation.\r\nSelf-reported anxiety\r\nConsidering self-reported state anxiety measures before and\r\nafter the virtual public speaking task (see Fig. 2), results from\r\nthe repeated measurements ANOVA point at a significant\r\ngroup difference, F(1, 59) = 13.570, p < 0.001, g2 = 0.187) and\r\n\r\nan interaction effect of time · group for the current sam-\r\nple, F(1, 59) = 9.242, p = 0.004, g2 = 0.135, but they reveal\r\n\r\nno main effect of time, F(1, 59) = 0.048, p = 0.827,\r\ng2 = 0.001. There was no significant mediating influence of the\r\ncovariates ‘‘sense of being there,’’ F(1, 59) = 0.027, p = 0.871,\r\ng2 = 0.001; ‘‘spatial presence,’’ F(1, 59) = 0.187, p = 0.667,\r\ng2 = 0.003); ‘‘involvement,’’ F(1, 59) = 2.161, p = 0.147,\r\ng2 = 0.035; and ‘‘realism,’’ F(1, 59) = 0.096, p = 0.757,\r\ng2 = 0.002 on group differences in self-reported anxiety.\r\nHeart rate measures\r\nThe Greenhouse–Geisser correction was used to interpret\r\n\r\nthe results because Mauchly’s test indicated that the as-\r\nsumption of sphericity had been violated (v2 = 173.160,\r\n\r\np < 0.001, e = 0.54). A repeated measures ANOVA was used\r\nto analyze HR data of the high anxious and low anxious\r\n\r\ngroups (see Fig. 3). Results indicate a significant main ef-\r\nfect of time, F(2.700, 159.295) = 6.035, p = 0.001, g2 = 0.093,\r\n\r\nand a significant group effect, F(1, 59) = 4.493, p = 0.038,\r\ng2 = 0.071. These results show a significantly higher increase\r\n\r\nof physiological arousal in the group of social anxious par-\r\nticipants compared to individuals with lower social anxiety.\r\n\r\nMoreover, no statistically relevant interaction effect of\r\ntime · group could be found, F(2.700, 159.295) = 2.073,\r\np = 0.113, g2 = 0.034, for the HR measures. The inclusion of\r\n\r\npresence subscales as covariates revealed a marginally sig-\r\nnificant influence of ‘‘spatial presence,’’ F(2.700, 159.295) =\r\n\r\n2.685, p = 0.047, g2 = 0.044) on HR, while the other subscales\r\n\r\nTable 1.

The most common assumption is that\r\npresence and anxiety must somehow be related to each other,\r\nbut it is unclear whether this relationship is a linear one (i.e.,\r\n\r\na correlation) or whether presence may only act as a pre-\r\ncondition for anxiety to appear at all. Also, there is much\r\n\r\ndebate about corroborating subjective presence measure-\r\nments with physiological indicators. However, only a very\r\n\r\nsmall number of studies has actually evaluated the correla-\r\ntional validity between these measures. To add to a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the interplay between presence and anxiety,\r\nthe current study set out to analyze presence, self-reported\r\nanxiety, and HR in a sample of high anxious and low anxious\r\n\r\nparticipants, both holding a speech in front of a virtual au-\r\ndience. Below, the findings are presented separately for each\r\n\r\nanxiety measure.\r\nSelf-reported anxiety\r\nAs expected, participants with high social anxiety reported\r\nsignificantly more anxiety (STAI) prior to the presentation\r\nthan participants with low social anxiety. This finding may\r\nbe regarded an indirect validation of our group assignments\r\n\r\n(based on SIAS cutoff q35). In addition to higher preratings,\r\nanxious participants also reported significantly more anxiety\r\nafter the presentation. Here, we detected an interaction effect\r\nof time · group: while the low anxious group exhibited only\r\na minor increase in anxiety between pre and post assessment,\r\nthe high anxious group—as expected29—showed a large\r\nincrease in the post questionnaire. According to theoretical\r\n\r\nreasoning, the precondition for such a reaction is that par-\r\nticipants are in fact present. Only if they are present can they\r\n\r\nreact to a VE as they would in a comparable physical envi-\r\nronment (i.e., phobics experience anxiety when encountering\r\n\r\na phobic stimulus whereas nonphobics do not). Our findings\r\n\r\nsupport this assumption, and thus constitute indirect evi-\r\ndence for satisfactory presence levels.\r\n\r\nThis indirect evidence is further confirmed by high IPQ\r\n\r\nscores in our sample. However, in light of past re-\r\nsearch,13,14,16 it might at first be surprising that our groups\r\n\r\ndid not differ on the IPQ. Earlier findings imply that anxious\r\n\r\nsubjects tend to report more presence than nonanxious con-\r\ntrols in anxiety inducing VEs. Yet, this contradicts Slater,12\r\n\r\nwho states that a higher level of anxiety does not equal more\r\n\r\npresence, unless the participant confuses emotion and pres-\r\nence in a self-report measure.10 Logically, an increase in\r\n\r\nemotional intensity should not cause higher presence ratings\r\nin post questionnaires. Former studies, however, have shown\r\nthat subjective presence measures may produce inconsistent\r\nresponses influenced by prior experiences.34 Considering\r\nthis, alternative presence measures that are less prone to bias\r\n(e.g., behavioral indices) are needed to shed more light on the\r\nlink between presence and emotions.\r\n\r\nFollowing the above stated assumptions,12 we did not ex-\r\npect presence to be directly correlated with self-reported\r\n\r\nanxiety in our study. Instead, we assumed presence would, at\r\nmost, mediate group differences in state anxiety. Surprisingly,\r\nwe found two significant correlations between post exposure\r\nanxiety (STAI) and ‘‘realism’’ as well as ‘‘sense of being there.’’\r\n\r\nEven more surprising, these correlations were negative, im-\r\nplying two possible relationships: either more anxiety caused\r\n\r\nless presence (i.e., the person was too afraid to be present), or\r\nmore presence was responsible for less anxiety. Literature\r\n\r\nsupports the first relation: Bouchard et al.7 found that pres-\r\nence scores decreased while anxiety scores increased. They\r\n\r\ninterpreted this finding as evidence for a behavioral inhibi-\r\ntion caused by fear during virtual exposure. Their partici-\r\npants reported feeling too paralyzed to explore the VE, and\r\n\r\nhence were less present. Similarly, participants in the present\r\nstudy might have tried to control their anxiety by shifting\r\ntheir attention away from the virtual audience and toward the\r\nsurrounding physical environment, thus reducing their sense\r\nof actually being in the VE and impeding their evaluation of\r\n\r\nthe environment’s believability and realism. In future stud-\r\nies, behavioral measurements such as gaze direction and\r\n\r\nduration may prove to be helpful additional indicators for\r\navoidance behavior and concomitant decreases in presence.\r\n\r\nTo test for the hypothesis of whether presence would me-\r\ndiate group differences in state anxiety, we included it as a\r\n\r\ncovariate in the analysis. However, we found no influences of\r\npresence. This result may be interpreted as a reinforcement of\r\nthe hypothesis that presence only acts as a precondition for an\r\nemotion and does not influence its intensity. The emotional\r\nintensity may instead be attributed to the meaningfulness of\r\nthe VE’s content or its emotional relevance and appeal.6,13\r\n\r\nFIG. 2. Self-reported STAI state anxiety measure before\r\nand after the virtual public speaking task (mean – SEM).\r\n\r\nFIG. 3. Heart rate baseline and recordings during the 5\r\nminute virtual public speaking task (mean – SEM).\r\n314 FELNHOFER ET AL.\r\n\r\nHence, the interplay between trait characteristics and the VE’s\r\ncontent, rather than presence itself, seems to be decisive of the\r\nintensity of the emotion experienced by the participant.\r\nHR measures\r\nSimilar to past research,10,23,29 we found a substantially\r\nhigher physiological arousal in highly anxious participants\r\ncompared with low anxious participants during the speech.\r\nAt baseline, however, the high anxious and low anxious\r\ngroups did not differ in HR measures. This is in line with the\r\nassumption that phobic individuals do not show more\r\nphysiological arousal during relaxation than nonphobic\r\ncontrols, but that they tend to be more sensitive to their\r\nbodily signals and rather interpret them as signs of fear.35\r\nConsidering that in our study the two groups did not differ\r\n\r\nin their level of presence, it is safe to assume that trait anx-\r\niety, not presence, was responsible for the group differences\r\n\r\nin HR during the virtual public speaking task. Presence may\r\nhave acted as a gateway by first transporting the participant\r\n\r\ninto the VE and then opening the gate for the interplay be-\r\ntween the participants’ trait characteristics and the VE’s\r\n\r\ncontent. Furthermore, no direct correlations were found be-\r\ntween HR and presence in the current study, contradicting\r\n\r\nthe assumption that physiological indices such as HR may\r\nserve as a substitute measure for presence questionnaires.\r\n\r\nEven the notion that HR may corroborate self-report ques-\r\ntionnaires of presence has to be called into question in light\r\n\r\nof present and previous16,18 findings. In effect, HR is not a\r\nmeasure of presence but simply one of anxiety.7\r\nInterestingly, however, including presence as a covariate\r\nin the analysis revealed one significant influence: the IPQ\r\nscale of ‘‘spatial presence’’ showed a tendency to mediate\r\nthe relationship between trait anxiety and HR arousal in the\r\nvirtual public speaking task. This result has to be interpreted\r\nwith caution, since it is only marginally significant with a\r\nmedium effect size. Yet, it is particularly remarkable that the\r\n\r\nIPQ scale ‘‘spatial presence’’ in particular showed a medi-\r\nating influence. Spatial presence may be thought of as a key\r\n\r\nconcept of presence, since—out of all other scales—it most\r\n\r\nembraces the experience of ‘‘being there,’’ of being per-\r\nceptually embodied in a place other than the one in which the\r\n\r\nphysical body is located.36 In particular, the interaction with\r\n\r\nthe environment (i.e., tracking head movements and trans-\r\nlating them into the VE) is thought to add to the perceptual\r\n\r\nillusion of nonmediation and embodiment.2 Considering this,\r\nit is conceivable how, above all, a sense of spatial and\r\nphysical presence may have mediated the physiological\r\n\r\nsensations experienced by anxious and nonanxious partici-\r\npants. However, the level of interactivity with the VE was\r\n\r\nquite low in our study, since participants were only able to\r\nmove their heads and flip the slides but could not move\r\naround freely. Further studies, including more interactivity\r\nwith the VE (i.e., walking around and interacting with virtual\r\nobjects) could produce more conclusive results.\r\nLimitations and Conclusion\r\nThis study’s results are predominantly in line with\r\nSlater’s12 reasoning about emotions and presence. However,\r\nthere are at least three limitations to our findings: First, it\r\n\r\nmay be argued that participants were aware of being ob-\r\nserved by the experimenter during their VE exposure, which\r\n\r\nmay have impacted their experienced anxiety and presence.\r\nWithout a doubt, this is a great concern of experimental\r\nstudies in general. Yet, in view of the substantial presence\r\n\r\nlevels reported in both groups, one may claim that our par-\r\nticipants were well immersed and focused on the VE, thus\r\n\r\n‘‘forgetting’’ the observation. Nevertheless, future studies\r\n\r\nshould consider using one-way mirrors to decrease the ob-\r\nservational nature of the experimental setting and increase\r\n\r\nexternal validity. Second, the current findings are based on a\r\npopulation of students who, more than the average adult, are\r\nused to presenting in front of an audience. It is therefore safe\r\nto assume that their average anxiety level (both self-reported\r\nand physiological) may be well below the general public’s\r\n\r\nlevel because of prior practice. This should be taken into ac-\r\ncount when generalizing the findings. Third, our sample con-\r\nsisted mostly of women. This is particularly noteworthy, since\r\n\r\nprevious studies have implied gender differences in experi-\r\nences of and behaviors in VEs.37 Thus, future research should\r\n\r\nbalance samples set out to include analyses of gender differ-\r\nences when studying the link between presence and emotions.\r\n\r\nAlso, given that HR is not an appropriate direct indicator\r\nof presence, it should rather be treated as an indirect measure.\r\nIt should predominantly be used when comparing reactions to\r\na virtual and a physical stimulus to test for similarities in HR\r\n\r\nreactions to both stimuli.7 Alternative physiological indica-\r\ntors such as skin conductance level or electroencephalogram\r\n\r\ncould be evaluated accordingly. Of course, one has to keep in\r\nmind that physiological measures are reliant on situations in\r\nwhich the expected response is obvious and predictable, such\r\nas an anxiety inducing environment.38\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nWe would like to thank Jasmine Gomm, Anna Hoffmann,\r\nElisabeth Kastenhofer, Nora Po ̈sl, and Janka Scharfenberger\r\n\r\nfor helping us to acquire parts of the data, and Anna-Ka-\r\ntharina Heinzle for her support with the analysis of the HR\r\n\r\ndata.

We replicated both gender differences in CS and differences in CS between patients and controls. The relationship between exposure to VR and CS was partially mediated by anxiety. This implies that part of the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms, more specifically nausea and disorientation, was explained by anxiety as an intermediary variable.\r\n\r\nWomen reported more CS symptoms than men, but most of these differences were already present at baseline. When exposed to VR, women had a steeper increase in nausea symptoms. The gender difference in severity of CS symptoms is in accordance with others.[ 22] However, gender differences in oculomotor and disorientation symptoms existed before VR exposure and cannot be explained by either exposure to VR or anxiety levels.\r\n\r\nOur results replicate both findings about CS symptoms being present before exposure to VR in patients with an anxiety disorder,[ 28] and associations found between anxiety and CS symptoms.[ 29] ,[ 30] Our results replicate findings that significant correlations between anxiety and CS were found in controls[ 26] but not in patients.[ 27] ,[ 28] Our study indicates that a partial explanation may lie in a ceiling effect for CS symptoms, that is, CS symptoms were already high in patients before VR and remained high, whereas they were low in healthy controls before VR and increased during VR. A second explanation may be the partial overlap between CS symptoms and physiological anxiety responses.\r\n\r\nCS symptoms reported at baseline cannot be explained by exposure to VR, but are related to anxiety. The present study found that anxiety was a mediating factor for nausea and disorientation symptoms of CS, but not oculomotor symptoms. This suggests that anxiety may impact some, but not all symptoms of CS. This is in line with studies showing five individual symptoms of CS (general discomfort, fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating, and fullness of head) to correlate with reported anxiety.[ 29] ,[ 30] Especially two CS symptoms, general discomfort and difficulty concentrating, may reflect anxiety symptoms as they significantly load on the anxiety factor.[ 30] This is also in line with a study demonstrating that nausea symptoms are affected by reported anxiety.[ 24]\r\n\r\nWe found no increase in oculomotor symptoms after exposure to VR; previous research on the profile of CS found that oculomotor symptoms are the least likely to occur,[ 38] which may have influenced the statistical power. It is also possible that oculomotor symptoms (e.g., eyestrain and blurred vision) are physiologically less related to anxiety symptoms. The fact that mediation by anxiety is partial and is consistent with the finding that multiple factors influence CS.[ 18]'),

As expected, we found that public speaking anxiety decreases after the completion of the PST in participants with initially moderate and high level of publicspeaking anxiety. Our findings also confirmed that a PST is more effective for individuals with an initially high level of speaking anxiety compared with those with moderate anxiety. This study further contributes to the belief that state anxiety shows different patterns over time and across anxiety situations in participants with different initial speakinganxiety levels. For the low anxiety level simulations (e.g., anempty room) moderately anxious participants show an op-posite pattern compared with anxious participants (revealing a decrement instead of an increase in state anxiety). This isnot surprising due to their hypersensitivity to external stim-uli.1,11,28Healthier individuals show a typical habituationprocess followed by a decrement of anxiety in the samesession, as they do not appraise the situation as beingthreatening.22,23An alternative explanation is related to theconcept of presence, feelings of ‘‘being there’’ related to thedegree to which a medium can produce realistic represen-tations of objects, events, and people.41One could arguethat only highly anxious individuals perceive VR environ-ments as being real enough as they also perceive a real sit-uation very quickly as threatening even if the threat isnonrealistic.42However, previous research showed that highlevel of presence can be induced with a low level of repre-sentativeness of VR avatars.16This finding combined withthe fact that we used live videos of real audiences makes usbelieve that the different patterns found to relate to envi-ronment sensitivity levels and not a difference in feelingsof presence. Moreover, there is some evidence that intensityof (speaking) anxiety is not directly affected by the presencein VR.26We also discovered that after each PST session, onlyhighly anxious participants always felt immediately lessanxious, while for moderately anxious sample anxietysometimes increased. We can only speculate that highlyanxious individuals are much more relieved after being ex-posed to public speech situations as they normally are ex-tremely aware of stimuli in VR environments during thesessions that could form a potential threat.42Stepping out ofthe threatening situation will automatically lead to decre-ment in the state anxiety. Nevertheless, the habituation alsoeventually occurred in moderately anxious individuals as theincrement in state anxiety before each of PST sessionsgradually decreased over time.The current study has several limitations. The sampleconsisted of healthy (nondiagnosed) students. Applying thePST in patient population would probably increase its effi-cacy as the VRET used in our study was more effective forparticipants with an initial high level of public speakinganxiety. In addition, we need to be careful with the inter-pretation of the current results due to a small sample size asthe generalizability to a broader population is low. Anxietywas assessed by self-reports and there was no control groupincluded. To obtain more objective anxiety measurementsduring the therapy, future research should include biofeed-back applications. Finally, VRET future studies could focuson how to make use of VR to motivate participants to reducedropout rates. Higher motivation is achieved by includingfeatures in the VR environment such as rewards, personalpresentation slides, speech/voice recognition, and positiveand interactive feedback (e.g., relaxation when anxiety levelis too high). Moreover, it is highly recommended to ask theresearch participants to give a speech in a real situation be-fore and after the public speech training to ensure the effi-cacy of the training.We conclude that the PST is effective in reduction ofpublic speaking anxiety in students, although further researchis needed to establish whether this type of mobile VRET canreplace a VRET that is commonly guided by a therapist.Moreover, our data revealed differences in PST effects forhigh and moderate anxious individuals making an argument toadjust future PST devices based on those findings'),

For the low anxiety level simulations (e.g., anempty room) moderately anxious participants show an op-posite pattern compared with anxious participants (revealing a decrement instead of an increase in state anxiety). This isnot surprising due to their hypersensitivity to external stim-uli.1,11,28Healthier individuals show a typical habituationprocess followed by a decrement of anxiety in the samesession, as they do not appraise the situation as beingthreatening.22,23An alternative explanation is related to theconcept of presence, feelings of ‘‘being there’’ related to thedegree to which a medium can produce realistic represen-tations of objects, events, and people.41One could arguethat only highly anxious individuals perceive VR environ-ments as being real enough as they also perceive a real sit-uation very quickly as threatening even if the threat isnonrealistic.42However, previous research showed that highlevel of presence can be induced with a low level of repre-sentativeness of VR avatars.16This finding combined withthe fact that we used live videos of real audiences makes usbelieve that the different patterns found to relate to envi-ronment sensitivity levels and not a difference in feelingsof presence. Moreover, there is some evidence that intensityof (speaking) anxiety is not directly affected by the presencein VR.26We also discovered that after each PST session, onlyhighly anxious participants always felt immediately lessanxious, while for moderately anxious sample anxietysometimes increased. We can only speculate that highlyanxious individuals are much more relieved after being ex-posed to public speech situations as they normally are ex-tremely aware of stimuli in VR environments during thesessions that could form a potential threat.42Stepping out ofthe threatening situation will automatically lead to decre-ment in the state anxiety. Nevertheless, the habituation alsoeventually occurred in moderately anxious individuals as theincrement in state anxiety before each of PST sessionsgradually decreased over time.The current study has several limitations. The sampleconsisted of healthy (nondiagnosed) students. Applying thePST in patient population would probably increase its effi-cacy as the VRET used in our study was more effective forparticipants with an initial high level of public speakinganxiety. In addition, we need to be careful with the inter-pretation of the current results due to a small sample size asthe generalizability to a broader population is low. Anxietywas assessed by self-reports and there was no control groupincluded. To obtain more objective anxiety measurementsduring the therapy, future research should include biofeed-back applications. Finally, VRET future studies could focuson how to make use of VR to motivate participants to reducedropout rates. Higher motivation is achieved by includingfeatures in the VR environment such as rewards, personalpresentation slides, speech/voice recognition, and positiveand interactive feedback (e.g., relaxation when anxiety levelis too high). Moreover, it is highly recommended to ask theresearch participants to give a speech in a real situation be-fore and after the public speech training to ensure the effi-cacy of the training.We conclude that the PST is effective in reduction ofpublic speaking anxiety in students, although further researchis needed to establish whether this type of mobile VRET canreplace a VRET that is commonly guided by a therapist.Moreover, our data revealed differences in PST effects forhigh and moderate anxious individuals making an argument toadjust future PST devices based on those findings', 'We investigated the efficacy of the Public Speech Trainer (PST) in students with high and moderate level of public speaking anxiety in the Netherlands.

In the current VR environment/scenario, participants felt significantly more stressed and anxious when confronted by these common stressors in the exposure condition compared to the non-exposure one.  This  was  clearly  indicated  by  the  self-report measures (STAI, SUDS, and subjective stress). Similarly, changes were detected in participants’ physiological responses during the experiment. Furthermore, during the semi-structured interviews, almost all participants (96%) confirmed this finding by clearly stating that they felt greater stress in the exposure condition resulting from the triggered stressors. . The results also showed that the introduction of virtual stimuli induced significantly higher levels of perceived workload and sense of presence and led to different physiological reactions.

The latter difference did not reach the corrected significance level at follow-up. VR was neither more nor less effective than traditional exposure on the behavioural measure and on the measures of fear of social interactions, fear of negative evaluation and depressive mood.

Cybersickness (CS) is a negative side effect of VR exposure and is associated with treatment dropout. This study aimed to investigate the following: (a) if gender differences in CS can be replicated, (b) if differences in anxiety and CS symptoms between patients and controls can be replicated, and (c) whether the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms is mediated by anxiety. A sample (<italic>N</italic> = 170) of participants with different levels of psychosis liability was exposed to VR environments. CS and anxiety were assessed with self-report measures before and after the VR experiment. This study replicated gender differences in CS symptoms, most of which were present before exposure to VR. It also replicated findings that a significant correlation between anxiety and CS can be found in healthy individuals, but not in patients. In a VR environment, anxiety partially mediated CS symptoms, specifically nausea and disorientation. A partial explanation for the differences found between patients and controls may lie in a ceiling effect for the symptoms of CS. A second explanation may be the partial overlap between CS symptoms and physiological anxiety responses. CS symptoms reported at baseline cannot be explained by exposure to VR, but are related to anxiety. Caution is required when interpreting studies on both CS and anxiety, until the specificity in measurements has been improved. Since anxiety mediated the CS symptoms, CS is expected to decline during treatment together with the reduction of anxiety.\r\n\r\nauthor virtual reality; cybersickness; anxiety; psychosis\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe use of virtual reality (VR) in psychological treatment is expected to increase now that affordable technologies are available for clinical implementation.[ 1] VR can be more effective and less burdensome for patients[ 2] and more practical for therapists[ 3] than in vivo (real-life) exposure therapies. The use of VR in treating psychological disorders was introduced about 20 years ago.[ 4] This led to studies on VR treatment for various anxiety disorders,[ 5] eating and weight disorders,[ 6] depression,[ 7] autism spectrum disorders,[ 8] and substance-related disorders,[ 9] as well as paranoid ideation[ 10] and hearing voices[ 11] in psychotic disorders.\r\n\r\nAn important factor contributing to the effect of VR treatment is immersion, that is, the sense of being present in the virtual environment.[ 12] However, a common drawback of using head-mounted displays as a medium for immersive VR environments is the experience of cybersickness (CS),[ 13] also known as simulator sickness. CS is the occurrence of motion sickness-like symptoms when using VR and is related to increased treatment dropout.[ 1] As CS symptoms occur in 60 to 70 percent of participants,[ 14] this has a negative impact on treatment effects. CS is an unintended negative side effect and efforts should be made to limit negative effects while preserving the therapeutic effect of VR.[ 15]\r\n\r\nFour factors are reported to influence the occurrence of CS: ( 1) hardware and software choices for the VR system, ( 2) design of the virtual environment, ( 3) task characteristics, and ( 4) user characteristics.[ 15] ,[ 16] Examples of hardware and software characteristics influencing CS are visual surround of the display[ 17] and navigation (e.g., a mouse, joystick or treadmill).[ 18] The design of the virtual environment can influence CS by using dynamic auditory stimulation[ 19] and allowed movement (active vs. passive).[ 15] Task characteristics known to influence CS are duration of exposure to the virtual environment[ 20] and training.[ 21]\r\n\r\nUser characteristics that can influence CS include gender, affective symptoms, and mental health. Susceptibility to CS is increased for women and varies over the menstrual cycle due to hormonal variation; however, explanations for this gender difference are incomplete.[ 22] Affective symptoms (e.g., feeling stressed or anxious) may increase the experience of CS[ 23] ,[ 24] but the nature of this relationship remains unclear.\r\n\r\nVR treatment is used to expose patients to a virtual representation of their feared stimuli. During VR treatment patients will therefore experience high levels of anxiety. Physiological symptoms of anxiety and CS overlap and may confound both scientific research[ 24] and clinical practice. Anxiety disorders are much more prevalent in women,[ 25] making gender-specific relationships between CS, anxiety, and VR used in psychological treatment, an area of interest. It is also unclear why different findings emerge in healthy individuals and patients. For example, significant correlations between levels of experienced anxiety and CS were found in healthy controls,[ 26] but not in patients diagnosed with persecutory delusions exposed to a neutral VR environment.[ 27]\r\n\r\nHigh levels of CS symptoms were found in patients with an anxiety disorder even before immersion in VR.[ 28] Correlations were found between some CS symptoms and reported anxiety in a sample with both healthy controls and patients with an anxiety disorder.[ 29] Some CS symptoms may reflect anxiety more than side effects.[ 30] Thus, more clarity is required as to which user characteristics influence CS.\r\n\r\nThe present study aimed to investigate the following: (a) if gender differences in CS can be replicated, (b) if differences in anxiety and CS symptoms between patients and controls can be replicated, and (c) whether the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms is mediated by anxiety (Fig. 1).\r\nMaterials and Methods\r\n\r\nParticipants\r\n\r\nA total of 170 participants aged 18–35 years were earlier recruited for a large VR study.[ 31]\r\n\r\nFrom these, we defined a high liability patient group based on phenotype, that is, the experience of (subclinical) psychotic symptoms. This group consisted of two categories:\r\n\r\n- Fifty-five patients with a psychotic disorder according to the DSM-IV, with the exception of substance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. These patients were recruited at five outpatient departments.\r\n\r\n- Twenty patients with an at-risk mental state (ARMS), recruited among patients seeking help for nonpsychotic psychiatric problems at two outpatient departments.\r\n\r\nThe low psychosis liability control group consisted of:\r\n\r\n- Forty-two siblings of people diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who had no personal history of a psychotic disorder themselves.\r\n\r\n- Fifty-three control persons recruited from the general population; they had no history of psychotic disorder nor a first-degree relative with a psychotic disorder.\r\n\r\nOur previous study in this cohort found no difference in reported symptoms between the siblings and healthy controls,[ 31] allowing to combine both groups for the analysis.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion criteria were poor command of the Dutch language, epilepsy, and intelligence quotient (IQ) ≤75.\r\n\r\nEthical approval\r\n\r\nThis study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center (NL37356.058.12/P12.182). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\r\n\r\nVR setting\r\n\r\nThe virtual environment used in this experiment was a café. Participants could navigate the virtual environment using a Logitech F310 Gamepad. The Sony HMZ-T1 head-mounted display used for VR display of the café had a high-density resolution of 1280 × 720 (per eye), with 51.6 diagonal field of view, and built-in headphones. A 3DOF tracker (UM7 Orientation Sensor; CH-Robotics) was added to the Sony HMZ-T1 for head rotation. The researcher controlled the VR system and actions in the virtual environment using a graphical user interface.\r\n\r\nDetailed information on the conditions is already published.[ 31] The social stressors used in this virtual social environment (population density, ethnic density, and hostility) were found to elicit feelings of anxiety.[ 31] All participants participated in five conditions, each with different levels of social stress. Exposure to each condition lasted 4 min. The order of the five conditions was randomized to prevent a sequence effect.\r\n\r\nMeasurement instruments\r\n\r\nDiagnostic instruments\r\n\r\nThe Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States[ 32] was used to assess ARMS before participation. Psychotic disorder was diagnosed with either the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History[ 33] or the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry.[ 34]\r\n\r\nAnxiety was assessed by self-rated momentary subjective fear in units on an analog scale (subjective unit of distress [SUD]), ranging from 0 (no distress at all) to 100 (worst possible distress). Anxiety was first assessed before the experiments. Participants also rated their maximum anxiety during VR immediately after each of the five experiments. The mean of these five maximum anxiety scores was calculated and used for the analyses.\r\n\r\nThe self-report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)[ 35] was administered before and after the VR experiments. The SSQ measure\'s three distinct symptom clusters were labeled as Oculomotor (eyestrain, difficulty focusing, blurred vision, headache), Disorientation (dizziness, vertigo), and Nausea (nausea, stomach awareness, increased salivation, burping). The SSQ was scored according to the procedures by Kennedy et al.[ 35]\r\n\r\nAnalyses\r\n\r\nAnalyses were conducted with IBM SPSS version 23. For sociodemographic characteristics, differences in continuous variables between the groups were analyzed using t tests. If the distribution of a continuous variable was skewed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. Group differences in categorical variables were tested using χ2 analysis. Pearson\'s correlation coefficient (two-tailed) was used for correlations.\r\n\r\nWe used the MEMORE method[ 36] for two-condition within-participant statistical mediation analysis. The single test path-analytic approach by MEMORE eliminates the need for multiple discrete hypothesis tests about components of the mediation model, as the previous dominant approach[ 37] requires. A single test decreases the probability of an error occurring. The conditions were no exposure (baseline) and exposure to VR. MEMORE can be used to estimate the total (c), direct (c\'), and indirect (ab) effects of exposure to VR on CS and its subscales through anxiety in a two-condition repeated measures design. Bootstrapping ( 5,000 samples) was used. Fixed covariates such as gender (or other stable individual differences) are accounted for in the MEMORE model.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nDemographics\r\n\r\nA total of 170 participants were included: 95 controls in the low-liability group and 75 patients in the high-liability group.

Women reported more CS symptoms than men, both overall and for each CS subscale. These differences were present both before and after exposure to VR.\r\n\r\nNo significant gender difference was found in the increase in total CS symptoms when exposed to VR (rank sum Z = 1.19; p = 0.24), or for oculomotor and disorientation separately. Women reported a stronger increase in nausea than men (rank sum Z = 2.31; p = 0.02) when exposed to VR. Results for both overall CS and for each of the three symptom categories separately are presented in Figure 2. No differences were found between men and women in reported anxiety, either before or during exposure to VR.\r\n\r\nPatients and controls\r\n\r\nAt baseline, 81 percent of the controls and 96 percent of the patients reported at least one symptom of CS. Patients reported significantly more symptoms of CS at baseline than the controls. After exposure to VR, there was no significant difference in nausea and disorientation between the two groups. Results for both overall CS and for each of the three symptom categories separately are presented in Figure 3.\r\n\r\nAt baseline, there was a significant correlation between anxiety and CS for patients (r = 0.33, p < 0.01), whereas this was not found for the controls (r = −0.03, p = 0.74). In contrast, after exposure to VR, patients no longer showed a significant correlation between anxiety and CS (r = 0.19, p = 0.11), whereas the controls did (r = 0.53, p < 0.01).\r\n\r\nAnxiety as mediator variable\r\n\r\nFor all 170 participants, a significant correlation was found between anxiety and CS at baseline (r = 0.33, p < 0.01) and after exposure to VR (r = 0.34, p < 0.01).\r\n\r\nMediation results are presented in Table 2.\r\n\r\nTable 2.

CS was measured by the self-report SSQ. Anxiety was assessed by self-rated momentary subjective fear (SUD). MEMORE was used for two-condition within-participant statistical mediation analysis. The conditions were no exposure (baseline) and exposure to virtual reality. Fixed covariates, such as gender, are accounted for in the MEMORE model.\r\n    5 <0.05; ** <0.01.\r\n    6 SD, standard deviation.\r\n\r\nAnxiety mediated the relationship between exposure to a VR environment and the experience of CS. The direct effect (c\') remained significant, implying that the mediation effect of anxiety on CS was partial. Examination of the CS subscales revealed that the relationship between exposure to VR and nausea was partially mediated by anxiety. The relationship between exposure to VR and disorientation was also partially mediated by anxiety. Oculomotor symptoms had no direct relationship (c) with exposure to VR.\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nIn this VR study, the large majority of patients and controls reported at least one symptom of CS. We replicated both gender differences in CS and differences in CS between patients and controls. The relationship between exposure to VR and CS was partially mediated by anxiety. This implies that part of the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms, more specifically nausea and disorientation, was explained by anxiety as an intermediary variable.\r\n\r\nWomen reported more CS symptoms than men, but most of these differences were already present at baseline. When exposed to VR, women had a steeper increase in nausea symptoms. The gender difference in severity of CS symptoms is in accordance with others.[ 22] However, gender differences in oculomotor and disorientation symptoms existed before VR exposure and cannot be explained by either exposure to VR or anxiety levels.\r\n\r\nOur results replicate both findings about CS symptoms being present before exposure to VR in patients with an anxiety disorder,[ 28] and associations found between anxiety and CS symptoms.[ 29] ,[ 30] Our results replicate findings that significant correlations between anxiety and CS were found in controls[ 26] but not in patients.[ 27] ,[ 28] Our study indicates that a partial explanation may lie in a ceiling effect for CS symptoms, that is, CS symptoms were already high in patients before VR and remained high, whereas they were low in healthy controls before VR and increased during VR. A second explanation may be the partial overlap between CS symptoms and physiological anxiety responses.\r\n\r\nCS symptoms reported at baseline cannot be explained by exposure to VR, but are related to anxiety. The present study found that anxiety was a mediating factor for nausea and disorientation symptoms of CS, but not oculomotor symptoms. This suggests that anxiety may impact some, but not all symptoms of CS. This is in line with studies showing five individual symptoms of CS (general discomfort, fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating, and fullness of head) to correlate with reported anxiety.[ 29] ,[ 30] Especially two CS symptoms, general discomfort and difficulty concentrating, may reflect anxiety symptoms as they significantly load on the anxiety factor.[ 30] This is also in line with a study demonstrating that nausea symptoms are affected by reported anxiety.[ 24]\r\n\r\nWe found no increase in oculomotor symptoms after exposure to VR; previous research on the profile of CS found that oculomotor symptoms are the least likely to occur,[ 38] which may have influenced the statistical power. It is also possible that oculomotor symptoms (e.g., eyestrain and blurred vision) are physiologically less related to anxiety symptoms. The fact that mediation by anxiety is partial and is consistent with the finding that multiple factors influence CS.[ 18]\r\n\r\nStrengths and limitations\r\n\r\nThe primary strength of the study is that the CS symptoms were measured before and after exposure to VR. Also, three different CS subscales were measured instead of only nausea, or using a single-sickness scale. Second strength is that the inclusion of both patients and controls allowed examining group differences. Thirdly, the MEMORE method simultaneously used the CS and anxiety scores before exposure to VR, as well as scores after exposure, to estimate mediation effects.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the statistical power of this study was limited, as many participants reported little CS and little or no anxiety symptoms; this impeded more detailed analysis of the subgroups. Four of the SSQ items load on two subscales instead of one, which inflate the contribution of these items on the total score. As two of these items, general discomfort and difficulty concentrating, are known to be correlated with anxiety,[ 30] this might have affected analysis.\r\n\r\nOnly two specific patient groups were included and all participants were relatively young; both these factors limit the generalizability of our findings. Also, this study examined state anxiety only, whereas additional affect states should be explored in future research. As a stable individual difference trait, anxiety is accounted for in the MEMORE model. However, as it can influence both the anxiety response and the CS symptoms, more research is required to clarify its potential role. Another limitation is that anxiety was measured with self-report. Finally, this study used the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV instead of the current DSM-V; however, as there are only marginal differences in the categories of psychotic disorders[ 39] the effect on the individual diagnosis of each patient in the present study can be considered negligible.\r\n\r\nClinical implications and future directions\r\n\r\nThis study indicates that caution is required when interpreting studies on both CS and anxiety, until the specificity in measurements has been improved. Gender differences in CS should also be taken into account. Findings on CS based on controls cannot be generalized to patients. Reported anxiety symptoms may partially reflect CS symptoms and vice versa. The relationship between VR exposure and CS symptoms is partially explained by anxiety as an intermediary variable. When VR therapy reduces anxiety, the nausea and disorientation symptoms are expected to decline. In addition, CS symptoms decrease after repetitive use of VR.[ 40] If a patient reports anxiety and CS during the first stages of VR treatment and can tolerate this, we recommend to continue with VR treatment.\r\n\r\nFuture research should include patients diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and measure both state and trait anxiety. Replication with a larger sample size of a broad age range is necessary to be able to perform more detailed analysis of subgroups and further clarify mechanisms.\r\nEthical Standards\r\n\r\nThe authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, as revised in 2008.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (Veni 916.12.013 to W.V.).\r\nAuthor Disclosure Statement\r\n\r\nNo competing financial interests exist.\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1 Valmaggia LR, Latif L, Kempton MJ, et al..

Cybersickness (CS) is a negative side effect of VR exposure and is associated with treatment dropout. This study aimed to investigate the following: (a) if gender differences in CS can be replicated, (b) if differences in anxiety and CS symptoms between patients and controls can be replicated, and (c) whether the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms is mediated by anxiety. A sample (<italic>N</italic> = 170) of participants with different levels of psychosis liability was exposed to VR environments. CS and anxiety were assessed with self-report measures before and after the VR experiment. This study replicated gender differences in CS symptoms, most of which were present before exposure to VR. It also replicated findings that a significant correlation between anxiety and CS can be found in healthy individuals, but not in patients. In a VR environment, anxiety partially mediated CS symptoms, specifically nausea and disorientation. A partial explanation for the differences found between patients and controls may lie in a ceiling effect for the symptoms of CS. A second explanation may be the partial overlap between CS symptoms and physiological anxiety responses. CS symptoms reported at baseline cannot be explained by exposure to VR, but are related to anxiety. Caution is required when interpreting studies on both CS and anxiety, until the specificity in measurements has been improved. Since anxiety mediated the CS symptoms, CS is expected to decline during treatment together with the reduction of anxiety.\r\n\r\nauthor virtual reality; cybersickness; anxiety; psychosis\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe use of virtual reality (VR) in psychological treatment is expected to increase now that affordable technologies are available for clinical implementation.[ 1] VR can be more effective and less burdensome for patients[ 2] and more practical for therapists[ 3] than in vivo (real-life) exposure therapies. The use of VR in treating psychological disorders was introduced about 20 years ago.[ 4] This led to studies on VR treatment for various anxiety disorders,[ 5] eating and weight disorders,[ 6] depression,[ 7] autism spectrum disorders,[ 8] and substance-related disorders,[ 9] as well as paranoid ideation[ 10] and hearing voices[ 11] in psychotic disorders.\r\n\r\nAn important factor contributing to the effect of VR treatment is immersion, that is, the sense of being present in the virtual environment.[ 12] However, a common drawback of using head-mounted displays as a medium for immersive VR environments is the experience of cybersickness (CS),[ 13] also known as simulator sickness. CS is the occurrence of motion sickness-like symptoms when using VR and is related to increased treatment dropout.[ 1] As CS symptoms occur in 60 to 70 percent of participants,[ 14] this has a negative impact on treatment effects. CS is an unintended negative side effect and efforts should be made to limit negative effects while preserving the therapeutic effect of VR.[ 15]\r\n\r\nFour factors are reported to influence the occurrence of CS: ( 1) hardware and software choices for the VR system, ( 2) design of the virtual environment, ( 3) task characteristics, and ( 4) user characteristics.[ 15] ,[ 16] Examples of hardware and software characteristics influencing CS are visual surround of the display[ 17] and navigation (e.g., a mouse, joystick or treadmill).[ 18] The design of the virtual environment can influence CS by using dynamic auditory stimulation[ 19] and allowed movement (active vs. passive).[ 15] Task characteristics known to influence CS are duration of exposure to the virtual environment[ 20] and training.[ 21]\r\n\r\nUser characteristics that can influence CS include gender, affective symptoms, and mental health. Susceptibility to CS is increased for women and varies over the menstrual cycle due to hormonal variation; however, explanations for this gender difference are incomplete.[ 22] Affective symptoms (e.g., feeling stressed or anxious) may increase the experience of CS[ 23] ,[ 24] but the nature of this relationship remains unclear.\r\n\r\nVR treatment is used to expose patients to a virtual representation of their feared stimuli. During VR treatment patients will therefore experience high levels of anxiety. Physiological symptoms of anxiety and CS overlap and may confound both scientific research[ 24] and clinical practice. Anxiety disorders are much more prevalent in women,[ 25] making gender-specific relationships between CS, anxiety, and VR used in psychological treatment, an area of interest. It is also unclear why different findings emerge in healthy individuals and patients. For example, significant correlations between levels of experienced anxiety and CS were found in healthy controls,[ 26] but not in patients diagnosed with persecutory delusions exposed to a neutral VR environment.[ 27]\r\n\r\nHigh levels of CS symptoms were found in patients with an anxiety disorder even before immersion in VR.[ 28] Correlations were found between some CS symptoms and reported anxiety in a sample with both healthy controls and patients with an anxiety disorder.[ 29] Some CS symptoms may reflect anxiety more than side effects.[ 30] Thus, more clarity is required as to which user characteristics influence CS.\r\n\r\nThe present study aimed to investigate the following: (a) if gender differences in CS can be replicated, (b) if differences in anxiety and CS symptoms between patients and controls can be replicated, and (c) whether the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms is mediated by anxiety (Fig. 1).\r\nMaterials and Methods\r\n\r\nParticipants\r\n\r\nA total of 170 participants aged 18–35 years were earlier recruited for a large VR study.[ 31]\r\n\r\nFrom these, we defined a high liability patient group based on phenotype, that is, the experience of (subclinical) psychotic symptoms. This group consisted of two categories:\r\n\r\n- Fifty-five patients with a psychotic disorder according to the DSM-IV, with the exception of substance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. These patients were recruited at five outpatient departments.\r\n\r\n- Twenty patients with an at-risk mental state (ARMS), recruited among patients seeking help for nonpsychotic psychiatric problems at two outpatient departments.\r\n\r\nThe low psychosis liability control group consisted of:\r\n\r\n- Forty-two siblings of people diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who had no personal history of a psychotic disorder themselves.\r\n\r\n- Fifty-three control persons recruited from the general population; they had no history of psychotic disorder nor a first-degree relative with a psychotic disorder.\r\n\r\nOur previous study in this cohort found no difference in reported symptoms between the siblings and healthy controls,[ 31] allowing to combine both groups for the analysis.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion criteria were poor command of the Dutch language, epilepsy, and intelligence quotient (IQ) ≤75.\r\n\r\nEthical approval\r\n\r\nThis study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center (NL37356.058.12/P12.182). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\r\n\r\nVR setting\r\n\r\nThe virtual environment used in this experiment was a café. Participants could navigate the virtual environment using a Logitech F310 Gamepad. The Sony HMZ-T1 head-mounted display used for VR display of the café had a high-density resolution of 1280 × 720 (per eye), with 51.6 diagonal field of view, and built-in headphones. A 3DOF tracker (UM7 Orientation Sensor; CH-Robotics) was added to the Sony HMZ-T1 for head rotation. The researcher controlled the VR system and actions in the virtual environment using a graphical user interface.\r\n\r\nDetailed information on the conditions is already published.[ 31] The social stressors used in this virtual social environment (population density, ethnic density, and hostility) were found to elicit feelings of anxiety.[ 31] All participants participated in five conditions, each with different levels of social stress. Exposure to each condition lasted 4 min. The order of the five conditions was randomized to prevent a sequence effect.\r\n\r\nMeasurement instruments\r\n\r\nDiagnostic instruments\r\n\r\nThe Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States[ 32] was used to assess ARMS before participation. Psychotic disorder was diagnosed with either the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History[ 33] or the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry.[ 34]\r\n\r\nAnxiety was assessed by self-rated momentary subjective fear in units on an analog scale (subjective unit of distress [SUD]), ranging from 0 (no distress at all) to 100 (worst possible distress). Anxiety was first assessed before the experiments. Participants also rated their maximum anxiety during VR immediately after each of the five experiments. The mean of these five maximum anxiety scores was calculated and used for the analyses.\r\n\r\nThe self-report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)[ 35] was administered before and after the VR experiments. The SSQ measure\'s three distinct symptom clusters were labeled as Oculomotor (eyestrain, difficulty focusing, blurred vision, headache), Disorientation (dizziness, vertigo), and Nausea (nausea, stomach awareness, increased salivation, burping). The SSQ was scored according to the procedures by Kennedy et al.[ 35]\r\n\r\nAnalyses\r\n\r\nAnalyses were conducted with IBM SPSS version 23. For sociodemographic characteristics, differences in continuous variables between the groups were analyzed using t tests. If the distribution of a continuous variable was skewed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. Group differences in categorical variables were tested using χ2 analysis. Pearson\'s correlation coefficient (two-tailed) was used for correlations.\r\n\r\nWe used the MEMORE method[ 36] for two-condition within-participant statistical mediation analysis. The single test path-analytic approach by MEMORE eliminates the need for multiple discrete hypothesis tests about components of the mediation model, as the previous dominant approach[ 37] requires. A single test decreases the probability of an error occurring. The conditions were no exposure (baseline) and exposure to VR. MEMORE can be used to estimate the total (c), direct (c\'), and indirect (ab) effects of exposure to VR on CS and its subscales through anxiety in a two-condition repeated measures design. Bootstrapping ( 5,000 samples) was used. Fixed covariates such as gender (or other stable individual differences) are accounted for in the MEMORE model.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nDemographics\r\n\r\nA total of 170 participants were included: 95 controls in the low-liability group and 75 patients in the high-liability group. Sociodemographic characteristics of the participants as well as anxiety and CS scores are presented in Table 1. Controls had a higher level of education and a lower use of psychiatric medication. There was a trend of more female participants in the control group.\r\n\r\nTable 1.

Women reported more CS symptoms than men, both overall and for each CS subscale. These differences were present both before and after exposure to VR.\r\n\r\nNo significant gender difference was found in the increase in total CS symptoms when exposed to VR (rank sum Z = 1.19; p = 0.24), or for oculomotor and disorientation separately. Women reported a stronger increase in nausea than men (rank sum Z = 2.31; p = 0.02) when exposed to VR. Results for both overall CS and for each of the three symptom categories separately are presented in Figure 2. No differences were found between men and women in reported anxiety, either before or during exposure to VR.\r\n\r\nPatients and controls\r\n\r\nAt baseline, 81 percent of the controls and 96 percent of the patients reported at least one symptom of CS. Patients reported significantly more symptoms of CS at baseline than the controls. After exposure to VR, there was no significant difference in nausea and disorientation between the two groups. Results for both overall CS and for each of the three symptom categories separately are presented in Figure 3.\r\n\r\nAt baseline, there was a significant correlation between anxiety and CS for patients (r = 0.33, p < 0.01), whereas this was not found for the controls (r = −0.03, p = 0.74). In contrast, after exposure to VR, patients no longer showed a significant correlation between anxiety and CS (r = 0.19, p = 0.11), whereas the controls did (r = 0.53, p < 0.01).\r\n\r\nAnxiety as mediator variable\r\n\r\nFor all 170 participants, a significant correlation was found between anxiety and CS at baseline (r = 0.33, p < 0.01) and after exposure to VR (r = 0.34, p < 0.01).\r\n\r\nMediation results are presented in Table 2.\r\n\r\nTable 2.

CS was measured by the self-report SSQ. Anxiety was assessed by self-rated momentary subjective fear (SUD). MEMORE was used for two-condition within-participant statistical mediation analysis. The conditions were no exposure (baseline) and exposure to virtual reality. Fixed covariates, such as gender, are accounted for in the MEMORE model.\r\n    5 <0.05; ** <0.01.\r\n    6 SD, standard deviation.\r\n\r\nAnxiety mediated the relationship between exposure to a VR environment and the experience of CS. The direct effect (c\') remained significant, implying that the mediation effect of anxiety on CS was partial. Examination of the CS subscales revealed that the relationship between exposure to VR and nausea was partially mediated by anxiety. The relationship between exposure to VR and disorientation was also partially mediated by anxiety. Oculomotor symptoms had no direct relationship (c) with exposure to VR.\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nIn this VR study, the large majority of patients and controls reported at least one symptom of CS. We replicated both gender differences in CS and differences in CS between patients and controls. The relationship between exposure to VR and CS was partially mediated by anxiety. This implies that part of the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms, more specifically nausea and disorientation, was explained by anxiety as an intermediary variable.\r\n\r\nWomen reported more CS symptoms than men, but most of these differences were already present at baseline. When exposed to VR, women had a steeper increase in nausea symptoms. The gender difference in severity of CS symptoms is in accordance with others.[ 22] However, gender differences in oculomotor and disorientation symptoms existed before VR exposure and cannot be explained by either exposure to VR or anxiety levels.\r\n\r\nOur results replicate both findings about CS symptoms being present before exposure to VR in patients with an anxiety disorder,[ 28] and associations found between anxiety and CS symptoms.[ 29] ,[ 30] Our results replicate findings that significant correlations between anxiety and CS were found in controls[ 26] but not in patients.[ 27] ,[ 28] Our study indicates that a partial explanation may lie in a ceiling effect for CS symptoms, that is, CS symptoms were already high in patients before VR and remained high, whereas they were low in healthy controls before VR and increased during VR. A second explanation may be the partial overlap between CS symptoms and physiological anxiety responses.\r\n\r\nCS symptoms reported at baseline cannot be explained by exposure to VR, but are related to anxiety. The present study found that anxiety was a mediating factor for nausea and disorientation symptoms of CS, but not oculomotor symptoms. This suggests that anxiety may impact some, but not all symptoms of CS. This is in line with studies showing five individual symptoms of CS (general discomfort, fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating, and fullness of head) to correlate with reported anxiety.[ 29] ,[ 30] Especially two CS symptoms, general discomfort and difficulty concentrating, may reflect anxiety symptoms as they significantly load on the anxiety factor.[ 30] This is also in line with a study demonstrating that nausea symptoms are affected by reported anxiety.[ 24]\r\n\r\nWe found no increase in oculomotor symptoms after exposure to VR; previous research on the profile of CS found that oculomotor symptoms are the least likely to occur,[ 38] which may have influenced the statistical power. It is also possible that oculomotor symptoms (e.g., eyestrain and blurred vision) are physiologically less related to anxiety symptoms. The fact that mediation by anxiety is partial and is consistent with the finding that multiple factors influence CS.[ 18]\r\n\r\nStrengths and limitations\r\n\r\nThe primary strength of the study is that the CS symptoms were measured before and after exposure to VR. Also, three different CS subscales were measured instead of only nausea, or using a single-sickness scale. Second strength is that the inclusion of both patients and controls allowed examining group differences. Thirdly, the MEMORE method simultaneously used the CS and anxiety scores before exposure to VR, as well as scores after exposure, to estimate mediation effects.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the statistical power of this study was limited, as many participants reported little CS and little or no anxiety symptoms; this impeded more detailed analysis of the subgroups. Four of the SSQ items load on two subscales instead of one, which inflate the contribution of these items on the total score. As two of these items, general discomfort and difficulty concentrating, are known to be correlated with anxiety,[ 30] this might have affected analysis.\r\n\r\nOnly two specific patient groups were included and all participants were relatively young; both these factors limit the generalizability of our findings. Also, this study examined state anxiety only, whereas additional affect states should be explored in future research. As a stable individual difference trait, anxiety is accounted for in the MEMORE model. However, as it can influence both the anxiety response and the CS symptoms, more research is required to clarify its potential role. Another limitation is that anxiety was measured with self-report. Finally, this study used the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV instead of the current DSM-V; however, as there are only marginal differences in the categories of psychotic disorders[ 39] the effect on the individual diagnosis of each patient in the present study can be considered negligible.\r\n\r\nClinical implications and future directions\r\n\r\nThis study indicates that caution is required when interpreting studies on both CS and anxiety, until the specificity in measurements has been improved. Gender differences in CS should also be taken into account. Findings on CS based on controls cannot be generalized to patients. Reported anxiety symptoms may partially reflect CS symptoms and vice versa. The relationship between VR exposure and CS symptoms is partially explained by anxiety as an intermediary variable. When VR therapy reduces anxiety, the nausea and disorientation symptoms are expected to decline. In addition, CS symptoms decrease after repetitive use of VR.[ 40] If a patient reports anxiety and CS during the first stages of VR treatment and can tolerate this, we recommend to continue with VR treatment.\r\n\r\nFuture research should include patients diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and measure both state and trait anxiety. Replication with a larger sample size of a broad age range is necessary to be able to perform more detailed analysis of subgroups and further clarify mechanisms.\r\nEthical Standards\r\n\r\nThe authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, as revised in 2008.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (Veni 916.12.013 to W.V.).\r\nAuthor Disclosure Statement\r\n\r\nNo competing financial interests exist.\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1 Valmaggia LR, Latif L, Kempton MJ, et al..

In particular, those with initial higher levels of dissociative symptoms showed a greater increase in dissociative symptoms following exposure to VR than did those with lower levels of dissociative symptoms. Sense of presence in objective reality also decreased as the result of exposure to VR. However, this time, preexisting levels of DP/DR did not mitigate the effects of VR on level of presence. The feeling of presence in a virtual environment, which implies detachment from objective reality, may temporarily compromise one’s connection with outer, objective reality. A tendency toward immersion or absorption, as measured by several different scales, related significantly to level of change in dissociative symptoms as the result of VR. [...] However, results suggest that the processes that increase dissociative symptoms as the result of a VR immersion may not be just pathological. Dissociative experiences lie on a continuum and may refer to completely normal imaginative processes like daydreaming. The effects of VR on dissociative symptoms were not in the clinical range or even within subclinical levels of dissociative experiences. The effects observed in the current study may be similar to spending several hours working at a computer and temporarily feeling more detached from objective reality than usual. It appears likely that the effects of exposure to VR disappear rapidly following subsequent immersion into objective reality. In addition, the dissociative effect itself may be dependent on the duration of VR exposure. Future studies need to shed light on the duration of the effect by following up with participants after VR exposure.'),

Thus, the current study analyzed presence, self-\r\nreported anxiety, and a physiological parameter (heart rate [HR]) in a sample of 30 high anxious and 35 low\r\n\r\nanxious participants. Both groups delivered a 5 minute speech in a virtual lecture hall. Results indicate no\r\nmediating influences of presence on group differences in self-reported state anxiety during the speech, but point\r\ntoward negative correlations between state anxiety and the iGroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ) scales ‘‘sense\r\nof being there’’ and ‘‘realism.’’ Furthermore, HR was found to be unrelated to self-reported presence. Only the\r\nIPQ scale ‘‘spatial presence’’ showed a marginally significant influence on group differences in state anxiety.\r\nThe present results support the assumption that presence and anxiety are logically distinct, meaning that presence\r\ndoes not directly influence the intensity of an emotion felt in a VE. Rather, it constitutes a precondition for an\r\nemotion to be at all elicited by a VE. Also, HR has proven to be no adequate substitute measure for presence,\r\nsince it only assesses anxiety not presence. It may, however, mediate the interplay between trait anxiety and state\r\nanxiety. Possible implications of the current findings are discussed alongside the problem of using presence\r\nquestionnaires that seem to be prone to subjective bias (i.e., participants confusing presence and emotion).\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\nFor virtual exposure to be an effective therapeutic\r\ntool, sufficient levels of subjectively perceived anxiety\r\nand physiological arousal are necessary.1 Both, however, are\r\nbelieved to be attained only if the person is actually present in\r\nthe virtual environment (VE). This experience of being there\r\nin an artificially created environment is commonly defined as\r\nthe ‘‘perceptional illusion of non-mediation,’’2 or, in other\r\nwords, as a disregard of the technology’s mediating role in\r\nthe creation of an environment. Hence, a person who is\r\nsubject to this illusion reacts to an artificial environment as\r\nif it was real,3 and may therefore experience the same level of\r\nanxiety as in a comparable physical environment. Despite\r\nthis theoretical reasoning, the empirical relationship between\r\npresence and anxiety is still far from being understood.4\r\nResearch to date has produced mixed findings, which on the\r\none hand may be attributable to cross-study differences in\r\n\r\nused methodologies, but on the other hand may also trace\r\nback to disagreements concerning the theoretical basis of this\r\n\r\nlink. Considering this, the current study aimed at investi-\r\ngating the relationship between anxiety and presence in stu-\r\ndents with social anxiety using a virtual lecture hall.\r\n\r\nSelf-reported anxiety\r\n\r\nThe link between presence and emotions has been iden-\r\ntified as a critical topic for examination,5 and has resulted in\r\n\r\na lively scientific debate in the past decade.6–12 This debate\r\n\r\nhas mainly evolved around the question about the relation-\r\nship’s direction, that is, whether an emotion increases the\r\n\r\nsense of presence, or whether presence enhances an emotion,\r\n\r\nor whether, after all, they interact with each other recipro-\r\ncally.7,10 Some studies have found positive correlations be-\r\ntween presence and self-reported anxiety,4,10,13,14 while\r\n\r\nothers have failed to find any connections.1,15,16 Most of\r\n\r\n1\r\nDepartment of Applied Psychology: Health, Development, Enhancement and Intervention, Faculty of Psychology, University of Vienna,\r\nVienna, Austria. 2\r\nResearch Group Entertainment Computing, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\r\n3\r\nDepartment of Sociology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria.\r\n*These authors contributed equally to this work.\r\nCYBERPSYCHOLOGY, BEHAVIOR, AND SOCIAL NETWORKING\r\nVolume 17, Number 5, 2014\r\na Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.\r\nDOI: 10.1089/cyber.2013.0472\r\n\r\n310\r\n\r\nthese studies, however, have methodological limitations:\r\nthey evaluate small samples16 with no controls,4 or use\r\n\r\nsingle-item measures of presence or anxiety instead of val-\r\nidated questionnaires,7,10,16 or they present these single-item\r\n\r\nmeasures concomitantly,7,10 thus inflating statistical corre-\r\nlations. Also, they seem to follow the presupposition that the\r\n\r\nmore presence a person experiences, the more anxiety he/she\r\nwill report in an anxiety inducing VE, or, conversely, the\r\nmore anxiety the person feels, the more presence he/she will\r\nreport. Accordingly, in some studies, highly anxious subjects\r\nwere reported to experience more presence in an anxiety\r\ninducing environment than nonanxious controls.13,14,16\r\nSome scholars,8,10 however, criticize that these positive\r\n\r\ncorrelations may simply be caused by the fact that respon-\r\ndents confuse emotion with presence (i.e., ‘‘I am more\r\n\r\nanxious, therefore I must be more present’’10).\r\nNaturally, this would contradict the above mentioned\r\ndefinition of presence. There, a higher level of presence does\r\n\r\nnot equal a more intense emotion; it rather reflects a con-\r\ncordance between the emotion experienced in a VE and an\r\n\r\nemotion experienced in a comparable real life situation.11,12\r\nThis is in line with Slater12 who states that ‘‘it is wrong to\r\nassume that high presence always implies strong emotion.’’\r\nThus, presence may be rather thought of as a gateway to\r\nemotion: there must be a certain amount of presence to be at\r\nall able to feel the emotion the VE is meant to elicit. Yet, the\r\nintensity of the emotion is not directly dependent on presence\r\nbut rather on the interplay between personal characteristic\r\n(e.g., high trait anxiety) and the VE’s (emotional) content.\r\nConsidering the above stated premises, presence is—at\r\nmost—expected to mediate the relationship between trait and\r\n\r\nstate anxiety (following the presence as a gateway hypo-\r\nthesis). Yet, it is not anticipated to be directly correlated to\r\n\r\nthe intensity of anxiety felt in a VE.12\r\nHeart rate measures\r\nGiven that self-reported presence questionnaires seem to\r\nbe prone to bias, corroborative physiological measures such\r\nas heart rate (HR) have been suggested to be used alongside\r\nsubjective measures of presence.5,17 Logically, these two\r\nmeasures should correlate if they target the same construct.8\r\n\r\nOne could argue that if HR (or any other physiological in-\r\ndicator) should ever serve as an alternative indicator of\r\n\r\npresence, it should somehow be related to what participants\r\nsubjectively report about their sense of being in the VE.\r\nDespite this requirement, only a very small number of\r\n\r\nstudies16,18–21—in contrast to a vast majority22–28—has ac-\r\ntually statistically correlated presence and physiological\r\n\r\nmeasures, and only one study19 found a significant positive\r\ncorrelation between presence and change in HR.\r\nHowever, from a theoretical point of view, an increase in\r\nHR—similar to self-reported anxiety—cannot be expected to\r\ngo hand in hand with an analogous increase in presence,\r\nsince an increase in HR merely reflects higher levels of\r\nanxiety, not presence.7 Considering this, presence may again\r\nbe understood as a gateway: it enables the physiological\r\nreaction but does not directly influence its intensity. In this\r\n\r\nsense, it is only a question of whether the physiological re-\r\naction in a VE matches the reaction that is expected in\r\n\r\nsimilar real life circumstances (see similarity paradigm8\r\n).\r\n\r\nStudies23,29 comparing nonanxious subjects to anxious sub-\r\njects in stressful VEs found that the latter group exhibited\r\n\r\nhigher physiological arousal, as they would do expectedly in\r\n\r\na comparable physical environment. This result was inter-\r\npreted as indirect evidence for presence, since participants\r\n\r\nreacted to the VE as they would have done in a comparable\r\nphysical environment.\r\nGiven these contradicting assumptions, more research is\r\nwarranted directly correlating presence and HR to assess\r\nconvergent validity and to test whether HR could at all be\r\nused as a corroborative measure of self-reported presence.\r\nFurthermore, studies are needed to evaluate the claim that\r\npresence acts as a gateway to a physiological reaction, thus\r\nmediating the interplay between participants’ trait anxiety\r\nand their subjectively perceived state anxiety in a VE.\r\nAim of study\r\nIn this study, presence shall on the one hand be introduced\r\n\r\nas a covariate to test for its mediating influence on differ-\r\nences between highly anxious and low anxious participants\r\n\r\nregarding their anxiety reaction (self-reported and HR) when\r\nholding a speech in front of a virtual audience. Additionally,\r\n\r\nintercorrelations between anxiety and presence shall be as-\r\nsessed to reinforce Slater’s12 claim and to test for convergent\r\n\r\nvalidity. Thus, three main research questions (RQ) can be\r\nstated for the current study:\r\nRQ1: Are there differences between high anxiety and low\r\nanxiety participants in self-reported anxiety when accounting\r\nfor influences of presence?\r\nRQ2: Are there differences between high anxiety and low\r\nanxiety participants in HR measurements when accounting\r\nfor influences of presence?\r\nRQ3: Are there intercorrelations between presence, HR, and\r\nself-reported anxiety?\r\nMethods\r\nAll participants were recruited via university courses, and\r\n\r\nreceived credits for their participation. The study was con-\r\nducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, and thus a\r\n\r\ncomprehensive informed consent was provided to all par-\r\nticipants prior to their participation.\r\n\r\nParticipants\r\nThe sample consisted of 65 German speaking students.\r\nParticipants with a score q35 on the Social Interaction\r\nAnxiety Scale (SIAS30; see measures) were assigned to the\r\nhigh anxious group, whereas students with scores below this\r\ncutoff formed the low anxious group. Hence, 30 participants\r\nreported high levels of social anxiety (2 males, 28 females;\r\nage: M = 22.97, SD = 2.512), and 35 showed low social\r\nanxiety (7 males, 28 females; age: M = 24.46, SD = 2.924).\r\nNo participant reported a clinically relevant history of a\r\nsocial anxiety disorder. All participants had corrected to\r\n\r\nnormal eye sight and reported no prior experience with ex-\r\nperimental VEs. Further exclusion criteria were existing\r\n\r\nheart diseases or a history of psychiatric disorders, as well as\r\npsychiatric medication and medication influencing blood\r\npressure. The majority of participants in both groups (75.4%)\r\nreported to have a lot of computer experience, compared to\r\nPRESENCE AND ANXIETY 311\r\n\r\nonly 24.6% of participants who indicated to have only little\r\ncomputer experience. There was no difference between the\r\ntwo groups, v2\r\n\r\n(1) = 0.871, p = 0.397.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\nAfter signing the informed consent form, participants were\r\nled to a quiet room to fill out a demographic survey and\r\n\r\npsychological questionnaires. Upon completion of the pre-\r\nassessment, participants were instructed to deliver a 5 minute\r\n\r\nspeech in front of a virtual audience. For this purpose, they\r\n\r\nwere provided with a printed version of the 20 slide pre-\r\nsentation and asked to get acquainted with it during a 5\r\n\r\nminute preparation period. The number of 20 slides was\r\nchosen to guarantee the participants would not finish the\r\npresentation before the 5 minute period ended.\r\nFurthermore, a fairly original theme (Bhutan’s geography\r\nand governmental form) was selected to ensure the subject’s\r\nnovelty. After the preparation period, the electrocardiogram\r\n(ECG) was attached, and the participant was asked to rest for\r\n1 minute. This relaxation phase constituted the baseline for\r\nthe subsequent ECG measurements. Then, the participants\r\nwere shown how to flip the virtual presentation slides using\r\n\r\nthe F710 Wireless Gamepad (Logitech Europe S.A., Swit-\r\nzerland), and the head mounted display (eMagin Z800 3D;\r\n\r\nBellevue, WA) with an integrated head tracking unit (360-\r\nhorizontal, >60-\r\nvertical), and two stereoscopic SVGA\r\n\r\nOLED displays (resolution: 800 · 600 triad pixels) were\r\ndonned. The experimenter took a seat behind a screen from\r\nwhere he/she could control the simulation and observe the\r\n\r\nphysiological measurements without being seen by the par-\r\nticipants. When the simulation ended, the participants were\r\n\r\nagain led to the assessment room to fill out the remaining\r\nquestionnaires.\r\nVirtual public speaking scenario\r\nThe virtual public speaking scenario was modeled after a\r\ntypical university lecture hall using Visual Studio C + +\r\nExpress as well as the Ogre3d (www.ogre3d.org/) graphics\r\nengine in combination with QuickGUI. The textures were\r\n\r\nprocessed with GIMP (www.gimp.org/), and real time ren-\r\ndering was achieved with Blender 3D (www.blender.org/). A\r\n\r\nstandardized protocol was applied for the experiment, re-\r\nsulting in both a constant number of 20 male and female\r\n\r\nvirtual characters in the audience and a constant distribution\r\nof emotions among the virtual listeners. Half of the virtual\r\ncharacters displayed a neutral ex<x>pression, whereas four\r\n\r\ncharacters had a slight frown and four smiled. Two charac-\r\nters who were seemingly bored rested their heads on the table\r\n\r\n(see Fig. 1).\r\nAdditionally, the virtual room was filled with the sound of\r\na quiet murmur, which, at times, was interrupted by a slight\r\ncough. During the whole presentation, participants—\r\nrepresented by their first person view avatars—were standing\r\non a podium with a display of the slides in front of them.\r\nThey could turn their heads but could not move freely around\r\nthe hall.\r\nMeasures\r\n\r\nBoth psychological self-report questionnaires and physi-\r\nological measures were applied alongside a short demo-\r\ngraphic survey.\r\n\r\nParticipant selection. In order to assign participants to\r\nthe high anxious or the low anxious group, the SIAS30 was\r\napplied. It assesses the trait component of interaction anxiety\r\nusing 20 items (e.g., ‘‘I have difficulty talking with other\r\n\r\npeople’’) on a 4-point Likert scale (‘‘not at all’’ to ‘‘ex-\r\ntremely’’). This scale was used to avoid a participant’s ten-\r\ndency to choose the rather uninformative, neutral middle\r\n\r\ncategory, and to allow for a better discrimination between the\r\ntwo groups. In the current study, the internal consistency was\r\nsatisfactory (Cronbach’s a = 0.87), and a cutoff value of q35\r\nwas used for group assignments.\r\nSelf-reported anxiety. Participants were asked to rate\r\ntheir level of situational anxiety prior to and shortly after\r\nholding the presentation on the 20-item state version (Form\r\nX1) of the State–Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI31). The\r\nitems (e.g., ‘‘I am nervous’’) were answered on a 4-point\r\nLikert scale (‘‘very’’ to ‘‘not at all’’). Internal consistency\r\nwas very high, with a = 0.89 for pre-assessment and a = 0.93\r\nfor post assessment.\r\nPresence. The German version of the iGroup Presence\r\nQuestionnaire (IPQ32) was applied immediately after the\r\nexposure in order to assess the level of presence experienced\r\nin the virtual lecture hall. The IPQ comprises 14 items on a 7-\r\npoint Likert scale (‘‘strongly agree’’ to ‘‘strongly disagree’’),\r\nwhich add up to three scales: (a) ‘‘spatial presence’’ assesses\r\n\r\nthe physical sense of actually being in the virtual environ-\r\nment (e.g., ‘‘I felt present in the virtual space’’); (b) ‘‘in-\r\nvolvement’’ evaluates the amount of attention focused on the\r\n\r\nvirtual stimuli (e.g., ‘‘I was completely captivated by the\r\nvirtual world’’); and (c) ‘‘realism’’ reflects the participant’s\r\n\r\nFIG. 1. Participants’ view\r\nof the virtual lecture hall\r\nfrom the front and when\r\nturning the head to the left.\r\n312 FELNHOFER ET AL.\r\n\r\nperception of the virtual environment as real and believable\r\n(e.g., ‘‘The virtual world seemed more realistic than the real\r\nworld’’). An additional single item—‘‘sense of being there’’\r\n(‘‘In the computer generated world I had a sense of ‘being\r\nthere’ ’’)—assesses the experience of perceiving the virtual\r\nsimulation as a place that has been visited. In the present\r\nstudy, the scales’ internal consistencies were comparable to\r\nthose found in previous studies33: ‘‘spatial presence’’ (a =\r\n0.77), ‘‘involvement’’ (a = 0.82), and ‘‘realism’’ (a = 0.76).\r\nPsychophysiological measures. HR was selected as a\r\n\r\nmeasure of the participants’ stress-related sympathetic ac-\r\ntivity. It was recorded via M-EXG (Schuhfried BFB 2000\r\n\r\nx-pert; Moedling, Austria) using three one-way electrodes\r\n(3M Medica RedDot electrodes; Perchtoldsdorf, Austria) of\r\nwhich two were positioned on the chest and one on the neck\r\n(reference). HR was monitored at 5 millisecond intervals\r\nthroughout the speech; 60 second intervals were computed\r\nusing the Kubios HRV software (Biosignal Analysis and\r\n\r\nMedical Imaging Group, Kuopio, Finland) for further anal-\r\nysis. High HR values (beats per minute) indicate high\r\n\r\nphysiological arousal, whereas low HR values represent\r\nlower physiological stress.\r\nResults\r\nStatistical analyses were carried out using SPSS v19\r\n(SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL), considering a significance\r\n\r\nthreshold of p < 0.05. There were no differences regard-\r\ning the baseline levels of HR measures (T49.5 = - 1.654,\r\n\r\np = 0.104), but as expected, anxious individuals reported\r\n\r\nhigher levels of self-reported anxiety (T63 = - 4.706, p <\r\n0.001) before the virtual public speaking task. Additionally,\r\nno significant differences could be found between high and\r\nlow anxious participants concerning their level of presence\r\n\r\nduring the virtual public speaking task (see Table 1). Fur-\r\nthermore, Table 2 shows intercorrelations of HR and state\r\n\r\nanxiety with the IPQ subscales. Only the scales ‘‘sense of\r\nbeing there’’ (r = - 0.306) and ‘‘realism’’ (r = - 0.280)\r\nshowed a significant negative correlation with the STAI after\r\nthe presentation.\r\nSelf-reported anxiety\r\nConsidering self-reported state anxiety measures before and\r\nafter the virtual public speaking task (see Fig. 2), results from\r\nthe repeated measurements ANOVA point at a significant\r\ngroup difference, F(1, 59) = 13.570, p < 0.001, g2 = 0.187) and\r\n\r\nan interaction effect of time · group for the current sam-\r\nple, F(1, 59) = 9.242, p = 0.004, g2 = 0.135, but they reveal\r\n\r\nno main effect of time, F(1, 59) = 0.048, p = 0.827,\r\ng2 = 0.001.

A repeated measures ANOVA was used\r\nto analyze HR data of the high anxious and low anxious\r\n\r\ngroups (see Fig. 3). Results indicate a significant main ef-\r\nfect of time, F(2.700, 159.295) = 6.035, p = 0.001, g2 = 0.093,\r\n\r\nand a significant group effect, F(1, 59) = 4.493, p = 0.038,\r\ng2 = 0.071. These results show a significantly higher increase\r\n\r\nof physiological arousal in the group of social anxious par-\r\nticipants compared to individuals with lower social anxiety.\r\n\r\nMoreover, no statistically relevant interaction effect of\r\ntime · group could be found, F(2.700, 159.295) = 2.073,\r\np = 0.113, g2 = 0.034, for the HR measures.

The most common assumption is that\r\npresence and anxiety must somehow be related to each other,\r\nbut it is unclear whether this relationship is a linear one (i.e.,\r\n\r\na correlation) or whether presence may only act as a pre-\r\ncondition for anxiety to appear at all. Also, there is much\r\n\r\ndebate about corroborating subjective presence measure-\r\nments with physiological indicators. However, only a very\r\n\r\nsmall number of studies has actually evaluated the correla-\r\ntional validity between these measures. To add to a better\r\n\r\nunderstanding of the interplay between presence and anxiety,\r\nthe current study set out to analyze presence, self-reported\r\nanxiety, and HR in a sample of high anxious and low anxious\r\n\r\nparticipants, both holding a speech in front of a virtual au-\r\ndience. Below, the findings are presented separately for each\r\n\r\nanxiety measure.\r\nSelf-reported anxiety\r\nAs expected, participants with high social anxiety reported\r\nsignificantly more anxiety (STAI) prior to the presentation\r\nthan participants with low social anxiety. This finding may\r\nbe regarded an indirect validation of our group assignments\r\n\r\n(based on SIAS cutoff q35). In addition to higher preratings,\r\nanxious participants also reported significantly more anxiety\r\nafter the presentation. Here, we detected an interaction effect\r\nof time · group: while the low anxious group exhibited only\r\na minor increase in anxiety between pre and post assessment,\r\nthe high anxious group—as expected29—showed a large\r\nincrease in the post questionnaire. According to theoretical\r\n\r\nreasoning, the precondition for such a reaction is that par-\r\nticipants are in fact present. Only if they are present can they\r\n\r\nreact to a VE as they would in a comparable physical envi-\r\nronment (i.e., phobics experience anxiety when encountering\r\n\r\na phobic stimulus whereas nonphobics do not). Our findings\r\n\r\nsupport this assumption, and thus constitute indirect evi-\r\ndence for satisfactory presence levels.\r\n\r\nThis indirect evidence is further confirmed by high IPQ\r\n\r\nscores in our sample. However, in light of past re-\r\nsearch,13,14,16 it might at first be surprising that our groups\r\n\r\ndid not differ on the IPQ. Earlier findings imply that anxious\r\n\r\nsubjects tend to report more presence than nonanxious con-\r\ntrols in anxiety inducing VEs. Yet, this contradicts Slater,12\r\n\r\nwho states that a higher level of anxiety does not equal more\r\n\r\npresence, unless the participant confuses emotion and pres-\r\nence in a self-report measure.10 Logically, an increase in\r\n\r\nemotional intensity should not cause higher presence ratings\r\nin post questionnaires. Former studies, however, have shown\r\nthat subjective presence measures may produce inconsistent\r\nresponses influenced by prior experiences.34 Considering\r\nthis, alternative presence measures that are less prone to bias\r\n(e.g., behavioral indices) are needed to shed more light on the\r\nlink between presence and emotions.\r\n\r\nFollowing the above stated assumptions,12 we did not ex-\r\npect presence to be directly correlated with self-reported\r\n\r\nanxiety in our study. Instead, we assumed presence would, at\r\nmost, mediate group differences in state anxiety. Surprisingly,\r\nwe found two significant correlations between post exposure\r\nanxiety (STAI) and ‘‘realism’’ as well as ‘‘sense of being there.’’\r\n\r\nEven more surprising, these correlations were negative, im-\r\nplying two possible relationships: either more anxiety caused\r\n\r\nless presence (i.e., the person was too afraid to be present), or\r\nmore presence was responsible for less anxiety. Literature\r\n\r\nsupports the first relation: Bouchard et al.7 found that pres-\r\nence scores decreased while anxiety scores increased. They\r\n\r\ninterpreted this finding as evidence for a behavioral inhibi-\r\ntion caused by fear during virtual exposure. Their partici-\r\npants reported feeling too paralyzed to explore the VE, and\r\n\r\nhence were less present. Similarly, participants in the present\r\nstudy might have tried to control their anxiety by shifting\r\ntheir attention away from the virtual audience and toward the\r\nsurrounding physical environment, thus reducing their sense\r\nof actually being in the VE and impeding their evaluation of\r\n\r\nthe environment’s believability and realism. In future stud-\r\nies, behavioral measurements such as gaze direction and\r\n\r\nduration may prove to be helpful additional indicators for\r\navoidance behavior and concomitant decreases in presence.\r\n\r\nTo test for the hypothesis of whether presence would me-\r\ndiate group differences in state anxiety, we included it as a\r\n\r\ncovariate in the analysis. However, we found no influences of\r\npresence. This result may be interpreted as a reinforcement of\r\nthe hypothesis that presence only acts as a precondition for an\r\nemotion and does not influence its intensity. The emotional\r\nintensity may instead be attributed to the meaningfulness of\r\nthe VE’s content or its emotional relevance and appeal.6,13\r\n\r\nFIG. 2. Self-reported STAI state anxiety measure before\r\nand after the virtual public speaking task (mean – SEM).\r\n\r\nFIG. 3. Heart rate baseline and recordings during the 5\r\nminute virtual public speaking task (mean – SEM).\r\n314 FELNHOFER ET AL.\r\n\r\nHence, the interplay between trait characteristics and the VE’s\r\ncontent, rather than presence itself, seems to be decisive of the\r\nintensity of the emotion experienced by the participant.\r\nHR measures\r\nSimilar to past research,10,23,29 we found a substantially\r\nhigher physiological arousal in highly anxious participants\r\ncompared with low anxious participants during the speech.\r\nAt baseline, however, the high anxious and low anxious\r\ngroups did not differ in HR measures. This is in line with the\r\nassumption that phobic individuals do not show more\r\nphysiological arousal during relaxation than nonphobic\r\ncontrols, but that they tend to be more sensitive to their\r\nbodily signals and rather interpret them as signs of fear.35\r\nConsidering that in our study the two groups did not differ\r\n\r\nin their level of presence, it is safe to assume that trait anx-\r\niety, not presence, was responsible for the group differences\r\n\r\nin HR during the virtual public speaking task. Presence may\r\nhave acted as a gateway by first transporting the participant\r\n\r\ninto the VE and then opening the gate for the interplay be-\r\ntween the participants’ trait characteristics and the VE’s\r\n\r\ncontent. Furthermore, no direct correlations were found be-\r\ntween HR and presence in the current study, contradicting\r\n\r\nthe assumption that physiological indices such as HR may\r\nserve as a substitute measure for presence questionnaires.\r\n\r\nEven the notion that HR may corroborate self-report ques-\r\ntionnaires of presence has to be called into question in light\r\n\r\nof present and previous16,18 findings. In effect, HR is not a\r\nmeasure of presence but simply one of anxiety.7\r\nInterestingly, however, including presence as a covariate\r\nin the analysis revealed one significant influence: the IPQ\r\nscale of ‘‘spatial presence’’ showed a tendency to mediate\r\nthe relationship between trait anxiety and HR arousal in the\r\nvirtual public speaking task. This result has to be interpreted\r\nwith caution, since it is only marginally significant with a\r\nmedium effect size. Yet, it is particularly remarkable that the\r\n\r\nIPQ scale ‘‘spatial presence’’ in particular showed a medi-\r\nating influence. Spatial presence may be thought of as a key\r\n\r\nconcept of presence, since—out of all other scales—it most\r\n\r\nembraces the experience of ‘‘being there,’’ of being per-\r\nceptually embodied in a place other than the one in which the\r\n\r\nphysical body is located.36 In particular, the interaction with\r\n\r\nthe environment (i.e., tracking head movements and trans-\r\nlating them into the VE) is thought to add to the perceptual\r\n\r\nillusion of nonmediation and embodiment.2 Considering this,\r\nit is conceivable how, above all, a sense of spatial and\r\nphysical presence may have mediated the physiological\r\n\r\nsensations experienced by anxious and nonanxious partici-\r\npants. However, the level of interactivity with the VE was\r\n\r\nquite low in our study, since participants were only able to\r\nmove their heads and flip the slides but could not move\r\naround freely. Further studies, including more interactivity\r\nwith the VE (i.e., walking around and interacting with virtual\r\nobjects) could produce more conclusive results.\r\nLimitations and Conclusion\r\nThis study’s results are predominantly in line with\r\nSlater’s12 reasoning about emotions and presence. However,\r\nthere are at least three limitations to our findings: First, it\r\n\r\nmay be argued that participants were aware of being ob-\r\nserved by the experimenter during their VE exposure, which\r\n\r\nmay have impacted their experienced anxiety and presence.\r\nWithout a doubt, this is a great concern of experimental\r\nstudies in general. Yet, in view of the substantial presence\r\n\r\nlevels reported in both groups, one may claim that our par-\r\nticipants were well immersed and focused on the VE, thus\r\n\r\n‘‘forgetting’’ the observation. Nevertheless, future studies\r\n\r\nshould consider using one-way mirrors to decrease the ob-\r\nservational nature of the experimental setting and increase\r\n\r\nexternal validity. Second, the current findings are based on a\r\npopulation of students who, more than the average adult, are\r\nused to presenting in front of an audience. It is therefore safe\r\nto assume that their average anxiety level (both self-reported\r\nand physiological) may be well below the general public’s\r\n\r\nlevel because of prior practice. This should be taken into ac-\r\ncount when generalizing the findings. Third, our sample con-\r\nsisted mostly of women. This is particularly noteworthy, since\r\n\r\nprevious studies have implied gender differences in experi-\r\nences of and behaviors in VEs.37 Thus, future research should\r\n\r\nbalance samples set out to include analyses of gender differ-\r\nences when studying the link between presence and emotions.\r\n\r\nAlso, given that HR is not an appropriate direct indicator\r\nof presence, it should rather be treated as an indirect measure.\r\nIt should predominantly be used when comparing reactions to\r\na virtual and a physical stimulus to test for similarities in HR\r\n\r\nreactions to both stimuli.7 Alternative physiological indica-\r\ntors such as skin conductance level or electroencephalogram\r\n\r\ncould be evaluated accordingly. Of course, one has to keep in\r\nmind that physiological measures are reliant on situations in\r\nwhich the expected response is obvious and predictable, such\r\nas an anxiety inducing environment.38\r\nAcknowledgments\r\nWe would like to thank Jasmine Gomm, Anna Hoffmann,\r\nElisabeth Kastenhofer, Nora Po ̈sl, and Janka Scharfenberger\r\n\r\nfor helping us to acquire parts of the data, and Anna-Ka-\r\ntharina Heinzle for her support with the analysis of the HR\r\n\r\ndata.

The use of the HMD hel-met allows users to perceive a 3D stereoscopic images and to determine the spatial position in the visual environment via motion tracking sen-sors in the helmet. Meanwhile, users can hear sounds from headphones and interact with vir-tual  objects  using  input  devices  like  joysticks,  wands, and data gloves. As a result, users feel as  though  they  can  look  around  and  move  through the simulated environment [2]. Because of these characteristics, over the past decade  the  application  of  VR  technology  has  expanded from entertainment industry to clini-cal  medicine.  Researchers  and  doctors  have  explored the effects of VR simulation on physi-cal  rehabilitation,  pain  management,  surgery  training,  anatomical  education  and  treatment  of psychiatric disorders [1, 3-7]. Compared with traditional methods, VR technology is regarded as  a  cost-effective  and  efficient  tool  in  the aforementioned areas.Although VR devices have similar structure, the discrepancies in hardware and software requi- rements often arise due to different application fields.  In  addition,  different  researchers  em-phasize different models of research utilization. For example, VR simulators for education focus on the 3D environment and network resources [8]. VR simulators for surgical training focus on the  interaction  with  operation  devices  and  vir-tual anatomical structure [9, 10]. VR simulators for  psychological  disorders  focus  on  the  emo-tion  control  and  feedback.  The  main  objective  of this paper is to discuss the application of VR technology in clinical medicine. The three app- roaches  addressed  in  this  paper  have  been  research  hotspots  for  over  two  decades,  and  thus far they have been subject of many stud-ies.  By  summarizing  the  current  research  re- sults, we analyze the advantages of VR technol-ogy  for  each  field,  and  make  predictions  for future utilizations. VR technology for surgery trainingFor decades, the acquisition of technical skills in the operating room under the supervision of senior  surgeons  has  been  the  only  way  for  junior  doctors  to  receive  surgical  training  [11].  As  the  number  of  trainees  has  increased,  the  opportunities  to  acquire  necessary  technical  skills  have  become  increasingly  limited  due  to  the higher costs, ethical concerns, and decreas-ing resident work hours. A reduction in training hours  has  been  caused  by  introduction  of  the  European  Working  Time  Directive  (EWTD)  ac- ross  Europe,  and  the  80  hours  per  week  limit  introduced by the Accreditation Council for Gra-duate Medical Education (ACGME) [12, 13]. The real and immediate consequence of these poli-cies  was  a  continuous  reduction  in  ‘hands-on’  experience  and  independent  surgical  experi-ence for trainees [14]. Furthermore, as the sur-gical  techniques  have  advanced  and  evolved,  sole observation was no longer enough for ac- quiring certain skills and special techniques. In these  circumstances,  VR  training  has  become  an  essential  prerequisite  for  junior  doctors  before  they  are  allowed  to  actively  participate  in real operations.Compared   with   animal   modes,   videos   and   e-learning,  VR  simulations  are  more  realistic  due to very intuitive anatomic structures exhib-ited in the 3D graphics (Table 1). Trainees can interact   with   all   the   anatomical   structures,  including skin, muscle, bone, nerve, and blood vessel. Changes that occur following each sur-gical step are very much the same as in reality. Whole  performance  can  be  recorded,  com-pared and analyzed, making data permanently available  for  trainees  [11].  From  different  per-spective,  senior  supervision  and  patient  par- ticipation are no longer needed during the peri-od of basic skill training and acquisition, since the  VR  simulations  can  provide  a  controlled  virtual environment necessary to satisfy these requirements  outside  the  operating  room  [6].  Multiple  aspects  of  a  trainee’s  psychomotor performance skills can be directly measured by the objective performance assessment offered by simulations. The training effect of VR simu- lations  are  generally  evaluated  by  standard  parameters,  including  time  necessary  to  com-plete  task,  path  length,  number  of  collisions,  injuries, number of anatomic landmarks identi-fied, number of loose bodies found, satisfac-tion and so on.Laparoscopic  To safely and effectively complete laparoscopic operation,  surgeons  must  face  a  long  learning  curve and extensive training. However, it is not possible for surgical trainees to practice basic surgical  and  laparoscopic  skills  in  the  operat- ing  room,  since  this  would  expose  patients  to  potential risks [5]. Due to these circumstances, VR  simulators  are  widely  used  in  laparoscopic  training   institutes,   since   as   already   stated,   acquiring specific surgical skills in the operat-ing room can be inefficient, time consuming, and potentially risky for the patients [6]. LapSim (Surgical Science, Sweden), Lap Mentor (3D System, USA), MIST-VR (minimally invasive surgical  trainer-virtual  reality,  Mentice  AB, Sweden),  Simendo  (Simendo,  Holland)  are  the  four  common  VR  simulators  in  laparoscopic  training  [5,  15-19].  MIST-VR,  the  earliest  VR simulator,  was  presented  by  researchers  from  Manchester  Royal  Infirmary  and  Virtual  Pre-sence in 1997 (Figures 1A, 2A). The initial sys-tem  consisted  of  a  200  MHz  Pentium PC with a 32 Mb RAM linked to a jig that con-tained two standard laparoscopic instruments. Trainees had the possibility to simulate some of the  manoeuvers  performed  during  a  laparos-copy by “grasping” and “manipulating”. Besides, it was possible to record, compare, and analyze individual task performance [20]. This was the prototype  of  modern  VR  simulators.  LapSim  and Lap Mentor, that appeared around 2002, have shown to be the most frequently used VR simulators (Figures 1B, 1C, 2B, 2C). Both com-prise  an  operating  platform,  cameras  and  a  monitor,  and  both  of  them  provide  basic  skills  training  and  procedural  training.  Trainees  can  practice  their  manipulation  and  surgical  tech-niques  through  nonanatomic  settings  and  vir-tual  patients.  Competence  level  of  trainees  could be assessed by a large number of quali-tative and comprehensive performance param-eters [21, 22]. Simendo, that appeared the lat-est  among  VR  simulators  mentioned  above,  has smaller application range (Figures 1D, 2D). It was initially designed to simulate the endos-copy  and  the  training  mode  was  similar  to  LapSim and Lap Mentor [23, 24]. Task comple-tion time and surgical skills have been shown to improve following training with all four kinds of VR simulators [5]. Interestingly, none of the four simulators incorporated HMD helmet as graph-ic output device in any of the available versions, including  the  latest.  This  could  be  because  operations  in  real  laparoscopic  surgery,  like  camera  manipulation,  hand-eye  coordination  and bimanual maneuvering, are accomplished by observing the monitor. According to the lat-est  research  in  2017,  combination  of  LapSim  with HMD helmet led to high levels of immer-sion, but there was no significant difference in the training effect [9].Orthopedics Compared  with  laparoscopic  and  other  surgi- cal disciplines, development and application of the  simulators  for  orthopedic  surgery  are  lag-ging  behind,  which  is  evidenced  by  a  small  number of studies that have attempted to cre-ate  or  validate  orthopedic  surgery  simulators  over the past two decades [25]. Among a very small number of available papers, research on VR   simulators   for   arthroscopy   stands   out.   Procedicus   KSA   VR   surgical   simulator,   Pro- cedicus virtual arthroscopy simulator (Mentice AB,  Sweden),  and  Insight  Arthro  VR  Shoulder  Simulator   (3D   Systems,   USA)   are   generally   used for arthroscopy training [11]. Procedicus  KSA  VR  simulator  and  Procedicus  virtual  arthroscopy  (VA)  simulator  were  devel-oped  by  the  same  company  and  have  been  employed  to  train  novices  since  2002  and  2003.  Procedicus  KSA  simulator  is  a  kind  of  endoscopic   simulator   with   haptic   feedback   and  anatomical  graphics.  Procedicus  VA  simu-lator was the first specific visual-spatial simula-tor  used  for  knee  arthroscopy  training  (Figure 3A  and  3B).  Besides  platform,  cameras,  optic  device, and probe, it also has haptic feedback. Trainees are instructed to complete tasks on a virtual knee, while the haptic feedback occurs every time an organ is touched. However, there was  no  evidence  to  prove  that  performance  would  improve  following  short  time  training  on the  simulator  [26-29].  Insight  Arthro  VR  Sh- oulder  Simulator  uses  a  life-size  plastic  shoul-der  with  predefined  portals  (Figure  3C).  The  input  devices  consist  of  two  robotic  arms  that  send haptic feedback to the user. This simula-tor  can  create  different  positions,  like  beach-chair or lateral decubitus that help young physi-cians  develop  necessary  skills.  In  addition,  trainees  can  choose  nonanatomic  tasks  for  training  of  basic  visuospatial  coordination  or  anatomic  tasks  for  procedural  skills  training.  This  VR  simulator  has  been  regarded  as  an  effective tool for both resident experience and shoulder arthroscopic experience [30, 31]. Besides  these  three  VR  simulators,  a  group  of  Japanese  researchers  has  assembled  a  VR  simulator  with  an  electromagnetic  motion  tra- cking   system,   Aurora   measurement   system   (Northern  Digital,  Canada)  and  an  artificial knee  model  (Pacific  Research  Laboratories, WA). A six degrees of freedom sensor was fixed beneath the knee model to detect surgical for- ces loaded on the joint and to provide the data on set of forces as well as torques. This simula-tor  can  make  quantitative  assessment  of  ar- throscopic skills [32]. VR simulators for open surgery, including total hip replacement (THA), hip trauma and fracture fixation,  have  also  been  investigated  by  re-searchers  [25].  Most  VR  simulators  placed emphasis  on  preoperative  planning  and  navi- gation  in  vivo.  A  simulator  named  HipNav  was  developed for THA training at Carnegie Mellon by Digioia et al. It contained kinematic hip joint models  and  tools  for  predicting  femoral  range  of motion, bone motion, and optimal alignment based  on  implant  placement.  It  could  aid  sur-geons in determining optimal, patient specific acetabular implant preoperatively and in trans-ferring it to surgical navigation in-vivo [33, 34]. The  TraumaVision  fractured  femur  orthopedic  simulator  (Swemac  Orthopaedics,  Sweden)  is  once-famous  VR  simulator  with  haptic  feed-back  that  aimed  to  recreate  the  sensation  of  drilling and reaming of cortical and cancellous bones  (Figure  4).  It  is  controlled  via  stylus,  which  serves  as  navigator  on  the  computer  screen. The haptic feedback provided by Ge-omagic Touch X (Geomagic, USA) device allows users  to  feel  realistic  resistance  when  in  con-tact  with  soft  tissue  and  bone  (Figure  5).  The  sensitivity of the haptic device can even gener-ate tactile differentiation between cortical and cancellous bone [35-37]. Jun et el have devel-oped  a  system  to  simulate  total  knee  replace-ment (TKR) surgery based on 3D knee models reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) scans.  The  system  guides  surgeons  to  fully  comprehend  the  patient’s  3D  anatomy  and  to  interactively determine custom implant compo-nents  by  extracting  knee  anatomical  parame-ters  from  3D  triangular  models.  A  virtual  sur-gery  based  on  a  preoperative  3D  simulation  can be used to obtain surgical parameters for resecting femoral and tibial models. The virtual implants are individually attached to the distal femur  and  to  the  proximal  tibia  following  the  resection.  The  axial  reference  of  implant  com-ponents is aligned with mechanical axis of the femur and tibia bone [38]. Other surgerySteven  et  al  have  reported  an  application  of  VR  simulator  in  mastoidectomy  performance  assessment [39]. They have chosen Visible Ear Simulator  (VES),  a  fully  functional  3D  virtual  temporal  bone  simulator  with  force  feedback,  to  complete  this  task.  Participants  have  per-formed a complete mastoidectomy by entering the  antrum  through  a  virtual  temporal  bone,  and the results have showed successful acqui-sition of basic competencies.EYESI, produced by VRMagic, is currently the only VR surgical training system for ophthalmic surgery available on the market. It is a monitor-based simulator with modular that allows for a breadth of ophthalmic surgical procedures, like vitreoretinal surgery and capsulorhexis [40]. Advantages and limitations  As  an  upcoming  tool  in  surgery  training  pro-grams,  VR  simulators  focus  on  the  advanced  stages of training. They can provide automated scoring  with  numerous  objective  metrics,  that  are very promising alternative for the laborious and  subjective  ratings  usually  performed  by  experts  during  live  or  videotaped  procedures  [41-43]. Compared with VR simulation, trainees that have received conventional surgical train-ing  have  been  found  to  perform  surgery  sub-stantially slower and to be more likely to cause injury,  damage  tissue  or  fail  to  progress  with  the surgery [44]. The immersive experience cre-ated   by   VR   simulation   provides   enhanced   understanding  of  complex  3D  body  structures  and  handling  of  instruments  for  trainees  in  a  controlled, risk free environment. Meanwhile, haptic  experience  in  surgical  simulation  can  help  trainees  to  familiarize  themselves  with  operation  process  and  to  develop  their  opera-tive  and  decision-making  skills  without  poten-tial  harm  to  patients  [45,  46].  However,  the  accuracy and efficacy of VR training still need to be improved. Density, palpable properties and convex  surfaces  are  very  challenging  to  simu-late  in  a  virtual  environment.  Moreover,  the response  rate  and  intensity  feedback  of  com-mercial haptic devices are too weak to correctly emulate vibration while drilling [47].An ideal VR simulator for surgical skills training must satisfy several conditions, including multi-modal training plans, artificial platform, accu-rate  haptic  feedback,  immersive  visual  and  audio technologies, sensitive input devices, as well as appropriate software with real time sim-ulation and assessment criteria. In addition, it should incorporate data from MRI or CT to pro-vide patient-specific simulations. Combination of  physical  body  models  and  actual  surgical  tools with VR simulators promotes the interac-tion between realistic tools, virtual bodily fluids and  virtual  physical  materials.  Abnormal  and  patient-specific  cases  can  be  modelled  and assessed in VR simulators for trainees to prac-tice and to prepare in vivo. These features and limitations may provide some directions for the future development of VR technology for surgi-cal skills training [25]. VR technology for pain managementPain,  that  is  acute,  intermittent,  or  chronic  in  nature, is the most universal medical complaint among  hospitalized  patients.  To  enhance  pain  management, physical and psychosocial treat-ments  must  occur  simultaneously.  However,  since pain has different causes, it is difficult to  establish  standards  for  when  and  how  to  change  pain  therapy  and  how  to  deliver  the  same [48]. VR technology has been firstly pro-posed as a tool for pain modulation by Hoffman et al in 1998. This new treatment has shown to be  effective  in  reduction  of  burn-induced  pain  and  management  of  pain  in  other  situations  [49-52]. VR for acute pain managementAcute  pain  caused  by  operation  or  trauma  in- duces  a  wide  range  of  pathophysiological  res- ponses.  Inflammatory,  physiological  and  sub-sequent  behavioral  responses  follow  the  acti-vation of nociceptors through tissue injury. Sym- pathoneural   and   neuroendocrine   activation,   combined with uncontrolled pain, can ultimate-ly  lead  to  various  detrimental  responses  [53].  The  management  of  pain  in  the  acute  care  setting  often  relies  on  pharmacological  treat-ments,  such  as  anesthetic  and  analgesic  ag- ents,  to  attenuate  these  pathophysiological  responses [54]. However,  the  arrival  of  VR  technology  brought  another  path  for  the  management  of  acute  pain.  Debashish  et  al  have  investigated  the  effect  of  VR  based  games  in  management  of  burn-induced injuries. In their research, the VR equipment used to enable interaction with the virtual  environment  included  a  laptop  (Dell,  USA) with game software, a HMD (IOGlassess HMD with SVGA video resolution of 800x600 16  million  colors),  and  a  tracking  system  (In- tersense, USA). This randomized controlled trial study  has  proved  that  VR  technology  provided  analgesia  with  minimal  side  effects  and  very  little  impact  on  the  physical  hospital  environ-ment  [55].  In  addition,  several  other  studies  have confirmed that standard analgesia cou-pled with VR based games is effective in reduc-ing acute pain [52, 56, 57]. The composition of VR  equipment  was  like  Debashish’s  design,  including computer, HMD, game software, he-adphone and input device.  Another  cutting-edge  approach  for  use  of  VR  technology in pain management refers to aug-menting hypnosis, also known as virtual reality hypnosis (VRH). According to Patterson, no spe-cial hardware, besides VR equipment is neces-sary.  The  most  interesting  point  in  his  study  was  the  application  of  Vega  VR-world-building  software  (MultiGen-Paradigm,  Canada).  Parti-cipants “glided” through an icy 3D virtual can-yon  following  a  predetermined  path  and  shot  virtual  snowballs  at  virtual  snowmen,  igloos,  robots,  and  penguins.  Sound  effects  and  ani-mated  colors  were  simultaneously  incorporat-ed in VR condition [58]. The patients reported lower levels of pain and anxiety under this con-dition. In a study published in 2009, based on hypnotherapy  theory  researchers  have  devel-oped a VR sequence to replace distraction type programs. The use of VR for relaxation, in addi-tion to use of morphine for pain reduction have shown to be very effective [59]. VR for chronic pain managementChronic pain is typically defined as pain lasting longer  than  three  months,  or  beyond  the  ex- pected period of healing [60]. Chronic pain con-ditions  are  difficult  to  treat  because  of  non-effective traditional pharmacologic treatments and invasive nerve blocks. Recent advantages in functional imaging technology have revealed that chronic pain conditions are caused by neu-ronal  plasticity  in  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS),  even  though  the  underlying  pathogene-sis  has  not  been  fully  understood  [61].  Only  a  few studies have investigated the use of VR for chronic pain management, therefore very little is  known  about  the  use  of  VR  for  chronic  pain  treatment and for long-term pain rehabilitation [1]. Sato  et  al  have  developed  an  advanced  VR  based mirror visual feedback system and have used  it  to  treat  complex  regional  pain  syn-drome.   The   non-immersive   computer-based   desktop VR system includes a computer, a real-time  position  and  motion  tracker  (Polhems,  USA),  a  CyberGlove  (Immersion,  USA)  that serves  as  a  hand  input  device,  and  a  monitor.  A  virtual  environment  was  developed  using  Autodesk 3DS Max (San Rafael, USA), where the  exercises  are  target-oriented  motor  con-trolled tasks via various movements like reach-ing  out,  grasping,  transferring,  and  placing.  Their  study  has  demonstrated  that  VR  system  might increase analgesic efficacy and provide a  promising  alternative  treatment  for  complex  regional pain [62]. Besides, the effect of track-er-based VR system on chronic neck pain treat-ment has been investigated. Participants were asked “spray” flies that randomly appeared in the virtual environment provided by the HMD. Researchers  have  assessed  cervical  range  of  motion,  which  has  shown  to  be  significantly related  with  pathophysiology  of  chronic  neck  pain [63]. Advantages and future perspectiveThe  most  powerful  analgesics  cannot  control  pain  in  every  patient,  although  opioid  analge-sics  (e.g.,  morphine  and  its  derivatives)  have  proven  to  be  quite  effective  in  providing  pain  relief [64]. VR technology and hypnosis are two potential  alternatives  to  pharmacologic  treat-ments  of  pain.  The  use  of  VR  technology  that  enhances  distraction  has  shown  to  be  rela- tively  effective  method  for  pain  management  (Figure  6).  VR  can  affect  pain  perception  th- rough immersive virtual environment, by occu-pying finite attentional resources and by block-ing  external  stimulation  associated  with  real  environment  and  the  painful  stimuli  [65].  Sin- ce distraction interventions work by competing for  attention  otherwise  directed  towards  pain-ful  stimuli,  pain  tolerance  and  pain  threshold  have  shown  to  increase  under  VR  conditions  [66, 67]. Moreover, pain intensity, anxiety and time  spent  thinking  about  pain  have  shown  to  decrease following VR distraction [67]. Immersive VR technology is more likely to gen-erate relief from pain compared to non-immer-sive  VR  technology  [68].  Pain  relief  effect  has  shown  to  be  correlated  with  technological  ad- vancement  of  instruments  used  to  generate  VR; the greater sense of presence in the virtual world  created  by  high-tech  equipment  that  in- corporate  an  active  cognitive  processing  com-ponent  are  more  effective  in  alleviating  pain  [69,  70].  Pain  signaling  in  key  pain  matrix  re- gions  could  be  inhibited  via  VR  technology.  As  the price of VR equipment keeps lowering, this approach  is  becoming  increasingly  affordable  and  could  potentially  turn  into  self-manage-ment  tool  for  pain  relief  used  by  patients  in  and/or  out  of  hospital.  For  example,  a  simple  Sony  PlayStation  with  a  VR  HMD  could  be employed to treat pain [67]. Although research results  support  the  premise  that  VR  devices  can  reduce  pain,  the  neurobiological  mecha-nisms still need to be determined. The current state  of  VR  as  a  tool  for  pain  management  is  still  in  its  early  developmental  stages  and  it  requires  numerous  applications  for  patients  with an array of acute and chronic medical con-ditions.  Nonetheless,  VR  technology  will  even-tually emerge as a promising first-line interven-tion  and  complementary  therapy  for  patients  with pain [1].VR technology for psychological diseases therapy The  treatments  for  many  psychological  disor-ders commonly require patients to confront the situations they fear. This kind of approach, also known  as  exposure  therapy,  helps  patients  to  accept their anxious emotions and consequent-ly  change  their  beliefs  about  the  likelihood  or  catastrophic  nature  of  feared  consequences.  Exposure  therapy  is  very  effective  but  hard  to  execute,   since   complex   conditions   such   as   social situations, thunder, injury and other pho-bic  stimuli  are  potentially  very  challenging  to  recreate and to expose individuals to the same in a real life setting [71]. Consequently, virtual environment created by VR simulators could be a valuable option for exposure therapy [72]. According  to  the  latest  randomized  controlled  trial for social anxiety, in vitro exposure through VR  has  shown  to  be  superior  compared  to  in  vivo   exposure,   based   on   self-reported   out-comes   registered   six   months   following   the   treatment [73]. Dana et al have designed virtu-al  environments  for  phobia  treatment.  They  have  searched  the  methods  for  creating  and  combining  virtual  objects,  environments  and  situations  for  therapy  (Figure  7A).  HMD  and data  glove  have  been  required  for  immersion  and active participation in the virtual world [74]. A  group  of  researchers  from  Spain  have  used  VR  system  to  enhance  emotional  skills  in  chil-dren  with  autism  spectrum  disorders  (Figure 7B  and  7C).  The  system  contained  L-shaped  screens, which allowed the child to observe the environment  from  the  frontal  view  and  to  act  from below. Mood and pose of the child were determined by a robot with an eye-in-hand sys-tem.  The  avatars  in  the  virtual  world  and  their  moods  were  design  via  3DS  Max.  The  child could interact with different avatars and could carry out a series of emotion recognition tasks, thus practicing the emotional responses [75]. Advantages and directionsVirtual  reality  exposure  therapy  and  virtual  re- ality  cognitive  behavior  therapy  have  become  effective  choices  for  patients  with  anxiety  dis-orders  and  other  phobias  like  fear  of  flying, claustrophobia,  acrophobia  or  generalized  so- cial phobia [76-79]. Instead of being exposed to the real world, patients can experience an anx-iety-provoking  scenario  in  the  realistic  virtual  environment  generated  by  VR  technology.  Pa- tients  and  therapists  can  both  benefit  from this kind of treatment, especially in view of ad- vanced  VR  technology  that  is  becoming  ever  more available [80]. Furthermore, VR technolo-gy  can  be  used  as  self-treatment  to  some  extent [81]. VR devices can be used in private practices  and  even  private  homes,  which  is  very  important  since  it  may  additional  aid  pa- tients to cope with unwanted feelings in “emo-tionally safe environments” [1].According  to  existing  publications,  the  soft- ware  is  the  core  part  affecting  the  treatment  outcomes.  Virtual  models  and  environments designed for medical therapies vary according to patient’s specific symptoms. The simultane-ous use of panoramic photos, videos and mod-els  controlled  by  the  therapist  may  be  helpful,  since  the  number  and  category  of  models  as  well  as  the  interaction  methods  with  virtual  objects  can  be  adapted  according  to  thera- peutic  progress.  Moreover,  measuring  princi-ples  are  vital  software  component.  Every  pa- tient’s symptom is different, each VR platform has  diverse  working  conditions  and  therapy  procedures largely depend on individual thera-pist’s decisions. An appropriate evaluation sys-tem  for  VR  therapy  alone,  or  for  VR  therapy  combined  with  other  therapeutic  methods  are  urgently  needed.  Treatment  of  psychological  diseases  is  very  time  consuming,  thus  VR  de- vices   providing   plentiful   and   vivid   contents   may  be  of  great  help  for  patients  going  throu- gh difficult periods.Conclusion Virtual  reality  technology  is  widely  applied  in  the field of medicine. Huge benefits have been reported following its use for rehabilitation, dis-ability  management,  surgical  training,  psycho-logical diseases therapy and analgesic modali-ty [3, 28, 36, 62, 76, 82]. This review presented current virtual reality based simulators for med-ical  application,  especially  in  surgery  training,  pain  management  and  therapy  for  psychologi-cal diseases. A comparison between operation methods  and  existing  simulator  features  and  relative  results  was  provided  to  demonstrate  the status quo as well as recent developments. In  addition,  new  directions  in  VR  technology  research  and  clinical  significance  were  ad-dressed by evaluating existing literature on the efficacy of VR simulators.AcknowledgementsThis   study   was   funded   by   the   Projects   of   International  Cooperation  and  Exchanges  NS- FC  (81420108021,  to  Q.J.),  National  Key  Te- chnology Support Program (2015BAI08B02, to Q.J.),   Excellent   Young   Scholars   NSFC   (816- 22033,  to  D.S.)  and  Open  Program  of  Jiangsu  Key  Laboratory  of  3D  Printing  Equipment  and  Manufacturing  (3D  L201601,  to  L.L.).

Eight researchers feigned auditory hallucinations, which led to admission with a psychiatric diagnosis in 12 hospitals in the USA. Nowadays, this study is often quoted to criticize  the  objectivity  and  reliability  of  the  diagnostic  process  in  psychiatry. Medical specialists in the somatic field can usually rely on numerous biological markers, such as blood tests and imaging techniques, to confirm and classify the suspected diagnosis. Up till now, such biological markers are lacking in psychiatry. A psychiatric diagnosis is still largely based on a clinical interview, a mental state examination, and multiple questionnaires (2, 3). This imposes the risk of recall bias, since important diagnostic information is depend-ent  upon  the  memory  and  current  state  of  mind  of  the  particular  patient.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  risk  for  interviewer  bias  since  the  conclusion on both the diagnosis and the severity of the diagnosed disorder is dependent on the interpretation of the clinician. To sup-port the objectivity and reliability of a psychiatric diagnosis, there is a clear need for new assessment methods. Objective and reliable assessment methods would also contribute to standardization and uniformity for research purposes.With  increasing  technological  innovation,  it  is  important  to  consider  virtual  reality  (VR)  for  this  purpose.  VR  is  defined  as  a  computer  generated  environment  using  sensory  stimuli  in  which  a  person  can  explore  and  interact  (4).  The  environment  can  be  displayed  on  a  general  computer  screen,  a  head-mounted  display  (HMD),  or  a  surround  system.  VR  environments  are  generally  designed to resemble real life situations and can be extended with specific  stimuli  to  provoke  symptoms,  like  disorder-related  items  and  virtual  humans,  which  are  also  known  as  avatars  (5).  These  VR environments, therefore, provide the opportunity to study par-ticipants in a lifelike, yet standardized and controlled environment. VR environments are increasingly used in psychiatric therapeutic settings to facilitate virtual exposure in behavioral therapy (6, 7). In this setting, the virtual environment is designed to provoke psychi-atric symptoms like fear and stress, after which gradual extinction can follow. If a VR environment is able to provoke and simultane-ously  measure  psychiatric  symptoms,  it  can  be  used  to  improve  reliability and objectivity in the assessment of psychiatric disorders. The  first  objective  of  this  literature  review  is  to  investigate  if  VR  environments are capable of simultaneously provoking and meas-uring psychiatric symptoms, thereby showing a relevant difference in outcome measures between patients with a psychiatric disorder and  healthy  controls.  The  second  objective  is  to  identify  correla-tions  between  VR  outcome  measures  and  traditional  diagnostic  measures including clinician or patient-rated questionnaires.MeTHODSWe searched the databases PubMed, Embase, and Psycinfo from January 1990 until May 2016. We used a combination of the key-words (diagnos*, assess*, or test) and (psychiatry or psychiatric) and VR. This search revealed 360 studies on PubMed. The same keywords  revealed  an  additional  two  articles  in  Embase  and  Psycinfo.  Additional  searches  on  multiple  psychiatric  disorders  combined  with  the  terms  VR  AND  diagnos*  or  assess*  were  also performed. The studies were screened for title and abstract when the title was suitable. After review, 39 relevant studies were identified. References of these studies and related citations were searched to identify eligible articles not located through the initial search of the electronic databases.Studies  were  included  if  they  concerned  a  VR  environment  used  in  the  assessment  of  a  psychiatric  disorder  and  made  a  comparison between a clinical and healthy control sample. We also included studies restricted to a clinical sample investigating a  correlation  between  VR  outcome  measures  and  traditional  diagnostic   measures.   We   included   only   English   language   publications.  Studies  were  excluded  if  they  concerned  a  VR  environment  used  for  therapeutic  purposes,  restriction  to  a  non-clinical  sample,  investigation  of  another  technology  than  VR  (e.g.,  telephone,  internet,  online  modules,  videoconferenc-ing, mobile technology, social media), and studies restricted to feasibility  testing.  Furthermore,  studies  were  excluded  if  they  concerned a computerized version of a neuropsychological test.ReSULTSPsychosis and SchizophreniaTo  date,  15  studies  have  investigated  VR  environments  in  the  assessment  of  a  psychotic  population.  Additionally,  one  review  of  the  implementation  of  VR  in  the  assessment  and  treatment  of  psychotic  disorders  was  found  (8).  The  VR  environments  measure  a  certain  aspect  of  psychosis,  such  as  paranoia,  social  behavior, and cognitive disabilities.ParanoiaUsing VR, paranoid ideations in reaction to avatars with a neutral facial  ex<x>pression  can  be  assessed  in  a  standardized  environment.  This  was  tested  in  patients  with  a  psychotic  disorder  in  a  virtual  underground tube (9, 10), a virtual café, and shopping street (11). In all these studies, paranoid ideations toward the neutral avatars were determined after exposure to the VR environment by scales specifically  developed  for  this  purpose,  such  as  the  State  Social  Paranoia  Scale  (12)  and  the  Virtual  Reality  Questionnaire  (13). The Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale (14) was obtained prior to  exposure  to  the  VR  environments  and  used  as  the  traditional  measure.   Freeman   et   al.   found   significantly   more   paranoid   ideations  attributed  to  the  neutral  avatars  in  the  patient  group  compared to healthy controls (9). This was in contrast to Fornells-Ambrojo et al. who found no difference between the patient and healthy control groups. However, in the patient group, they found a positive correlation (r= 0.62, p= 0.004) between paranoid idea-tion in VR and paranoid ideations in real life (10). Valmaggia et al. also found a positive correlation between rated paranoid thoughts attributed  to  the  avatars  and  paranoid  thoughts  experienced  in  real life (r= 0.61, p= 0.004) in patients classified as “at risk” for psychosis (15). Furthermore, Veling et al. also found a strong cor-relation  between  paranoid  ideations  in  VR  and  baseline  levels  of  paranoia (r= 0.67, p< 0.01) (11).Social BehaviorInterestingly,  the  assessment  of  social  behavior  in  schizophrenia  patients  is  possible  through  the  interaction  with  avatars  in  VR.  Dyck et al. showed that schizophrenia patients had more difficul-ties  recognizing  displayed  emotions  on  avatar  faces  compared  to  healthy controls (16). Kim et al. found lower scores on interpreting avatar emotions, verbal cues, and gestures in patients compared to healthy controls (17). In patients, they found a negative correlation between  emotion  recognition  and  positive  symptoms  (r=−0.49, p= 0.01) and negative symptoms (r=−0.36, p= 0.05) as assessed on the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) (18). In other studies,  patients  showed  less  gazing  toward  an  avatar  during  the  listening phase of a negative conversation (19), and kept a larger dis-tance toward an avatar compared to healthy controls. Patients with more  severe  negative  symptoms  measured  through  the  PANSS  kept less distance toward angry avatars (r=−0.42, p< 0.05) (20).Cognitive DisabilitiesMultiple research groups investigated cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients through VR, especially executive func-tions and memory. Executive functions were assessed through grocery  shopping  in  a  virtual  supermarket  (21),  medication  management  in  a  virtual  apartment  (22),  and  decision  mak-ing on a bus route (23). In all these studies, a comparison was made between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. In general, schizophrenia patients showed more erroneous actions in their grocery shopping and medication management, as well as less flexibility and more stress in the decision-making process on the bus routes. Significant correlations were found between scores on subtests of the supermarket environment and subtests on a standardized executive functioning questionnaire (21). The decision  time  in  the  bus  route  task  was  negatively  correlated  with  negative  symptoms  determined  on  the  PANSS  question-naire (r=−0.76, p= 0.01) for schizophrenia patients.Other  research  groups  investigated  both  spatial  and  working  memory in a virtual maze (24, 25) and a virtual city (26) in schizo-phrenia patients compared to healthy controls. In the maze, patients showed a higher error rate, especially in distractor conditions (24). Furthermore, patients needed more time to complete the task and covered  more  distance  in  both  the  maze  and  the  city  (25, 26).  In  patients,  negative  correlations  were  found  between  both  time  spent on finishing the maze task (r= 0.6, p< 0.001) and covered distance  in  the  city  (r=−0.48, p<  0.001)  and  total  scores  on  a  neuropsychological  battery  indicating  better  short-term  memory  and  spatial  learning  with  better  cognitive  performance  (25, 26). Another  research  group  tested  spatial  memory  on  an  allocentric  and  egocentric  level  (27).  Patients  differed  in  a  higher  number  of  errors and less learning progress over multiple trials on an allocen-tric, but not an egocentric level compared to healthy controls.Developmental DisordersSo  far,  four  studies  have  investigated  VR  environments  in  the  assessment  of  attention-deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  and eight studies in the assessment of autism.Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity DisorderIn ADHD, the most investigated aspects include errors, distrac-tion,  reaction  time,  and  hyperactivity.  The  research  group  of  Rizzo  et  al.  created  a  virtual  classroom  environment  in  which  participants  are  expected  to  conduct  a  task  from  a  traditional  continuous  performance  test  (CPT)  while  distracting  visual  and auditory stimuli are introduced. The aim was to assess both cognitive  functions  such  as  attention  and  inhibition  and  physi-cal  activity.  In  multiple  studies,  a  comparison  between  ADHD  patients  in  the  age  range  of  8–17  years  and  healthy  controls  revealed  a  significantly  larger  number  of  commission  errors  (28, 29), omission errors (29, 30), and a longer reaction time (30) in ADHD patients. Moreover, ADHD patients also showed more errors  and  an  increasing  reaction  time  when  the  task  had  to  be  repeated  several  times  (28).  Finally,  ADHD  patients  showed  a  higher level of overall physical hyperactivity. This was measured by tracking devices attached to the HMD, the hand, and the knee (29).  In  addition,  a  significant  correlation  was  found  between  the  percentage  of  correct  answers  in  VR  and  a  standard  CPT  (r= 0.64, p< 0.001) (31) Also, measures of correct hits and hit reaction  time  in  VR  and  in  a  standard  CPT  were  significantly  correlated  (coefficient  up  to  0.623,  p<  0.001)  (28)  as  were  the  number  of  errors  and  the  amount  of  hyperactivity  in  VR  and  behavioral  ratings  by  parents  on  a  behavior  checklist  (r=  0.51, r= 0.59 and r= 0.61, respectively) (29).AutismIn autism spectrum disorder (ASD), some studies in this field are directed at the assessment of social behavior in a virtual environ-ment. Emotion recognition, social distance, empathy, and socially appropriate  behavior  were  evaluated.  Emotion  recognition  and  empathy in response to avatar faces showing basic emotions were tested  in  two  studies  (32, 33).  Both  studies  found  the  ASD  and  healthy control groups were equally able to correctly recognize the displayed  emotions;  however,  the  ASD  groups  took  more  time  in  selecting  the  correct  emotion  and  showed  less  confidence  after-wards  (32).  Furthermore,  the  ASD  group  showed  less  congruent  emotions in response to the emotion displayed by the avatar (33). Parsons  et  al.  tested  appropriate  social  behavior  in  a  virtual  bar  (34). Compared to healthy controls, the ASD patients showed less of a tendency to avoid a couple standing at an otherwise empty bar when  ordering  drinks.  Kim  et  al.  found  subjects  with  ASD  were  more likely to virtually distance themselves by using a joystick from a “happy” approaching avatar compared to healthy controls despite correctly identifying the emotion of the avatar (35).Other  studies  in  this  field  are  directed  at  gaining  insight  in  the  pathophysiology  of  ASD  by  studying  neural  mechanisms  of   deviant   non-verbal   behavior   (36).   Four   research   groups   investigated  the  neural  mechanisms  in  response  to  avatar  gaze  direction or duration in ASD subjects (37–40). They consistently found deviations in the networks involved in the theory of mind (ToM) and gaze perception in ASD subjects compared to healthy controls. Von Dem Hagen et al. found an increased activation in both the ToM and gaze perception networks in response to direct gaze  in  healthy  control  and  an  activation  of  the  same  networks  in response to averted gaze in ASD subjects (40). Schulte-Rüther et al. investigated the neural processing of emotional responses to an emotion displayed by an avatar in ASD subjects. They found several deviations, which included an increased activation of the right temporoparietal junction and the dorsal area of the medial prefrontal cortex during processing in ASD subjects, speculating subjects with ASD address different cognitive strategies to access their own emotional state in response to emotions displayed by others (33).Forensic PsychiatryOnly  one  study  evaluated  the  use  of  VR  in  the  assessment  of  forensic  patients.  The  research  group  of  Renaud  et  al.  tested  both  sexual  arousal  and  oculomotoric  response  in  reaction  to  virtual adult and child avatars that were naked in child molesters and  healthy  controls.  They  found  a  more  pronounced  erectile  response  in  child  molesters  in  reaction  to  the  child  avatars,  as  opposed  to  healthy  controls  who  showed  this  response  to  the  adult avatars. Also, a more focused gaze toward the sexual rel-evant areas in all avatars was found in the child molester group, possibly referring to their sexual preoccupation (41).Substance Use DisordersIn  substance  use  disorders,  VR  is  mainly  used  to  study  craving  (42).  Craving  is  an  important  diagnostic  criterion  of  substance  use disorders and is defined as an intense preoccupation or urge to use the desired substance (43). Most of the studies using VR to assess craving in alcohol-, cannabis-, and hard drug depend-ence  focused  on  a  comparison  between  neutral  and  substance  cue-related  VR  environments  in  patients  with  a  substance  use  disorder and did not include a healthy control group.Virtual reality was used to create realistic scenes including sub-stance-related cues, avatars, and even the smell of beer or cannabis. The  studies  generally  showed  a  higher  level  of  subjective  craving  in VR environments containing substance-related cues compared to neutral VR environments (44–48). Only in the study of Saladin et  al.,  physiological  measurements  were  included;  they  found  an  increased  heart  rate  in  the  cue-related  environment  compared  to  the neutral VR environment in cocaine-dependent patients (48).Finally,  in  a  study  by  Lee  et  al.,  a  comparison  was  made  between  alcohol-dependent  patients  and  healthy  controls  (49). They tested a VR environment with alcohol-related cues and an environment  with  avatars  exerting  social  pressure.  Their  results  showed  that  both  patients  and  healthy  controls  experienced  an  increase in subjective craving in response to virtual social pres-sure  in  the  absence  of  alcohol  related  cues.  However,  only  the  alcohol-dependent  patients  experienced  an  increase  in  craving  in response to the VR environment with alcohol-related cues, as opposed to the healthy controls.eating DisordersWe  found  three  studies  using  VR  in  the  assessment  of  eating  disorders,  additionally,  a  review  article  was  identified  (50).  The  studies focused on body image and body dissatisfaction, but also on anxiety and physical reactions in response to virtual food or dining scenarios.Gorini  et  al.  investigated  anxiety  and  physical  reactions  in  response to virtual food (51). In eating disorder patients, anxiety, heart rate, and skin conductance in response to virtual food were significantly higher compared to healthy controls. Ferrer-García et  al.  studied  body-image,  body-dissatisfaction,  and  depressive  and  anxious  symptoms  at  confrontation  with  virtual  dining  scenarios  in  eating  disorder  patients  and  healthy  controls  (52). Patients  showed  more  body  distortion  and  dissatisfaction  in  all  virtual  scenarios  and  a  significantly  higher  level  of  anxiety  and  depression  compared  to  healthy  controls,  especially  in  the  scenarios with high calorie food. The same research group exam-ined  food  craving  in  response  to  virtual  food  in  patients  with  bulimia and binge eating disorder compared to healthy controls. They found a higher level of subjective food craving, determined by a visual analog scale (VAS), in the patient group in response to  the  virtual  food  compared  to  healthy  controls.  They  suggest  this  could  underlie  the  binges  and  higher  BMI  in  patients  with  bulimia and binge eating disorder (53).Mood and Anxiety DisordersWe found just a solitary study on the use of VR in the assessment of  mood  disorders;  Gould  et  al.  studied  the  spatial  memory  of  patients  with  a  depressive  disorder  in  a  virtual  city  were  differ-ent  locations  had  to  be  located  (54).  Depressive  patients  found  significant  fewer  locations  in  the  virtual  city,  and  this  finding  was correlated with the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (55) (r=−0.33, p= 0.02) and the performance on a spatial working memory task (r=−0.45, p= 0.007).In  anxiety  disorders,  six  studies  were  identified.  We  found  four studies on self-reported and physiological anxiety responses to a virtual tunnel in patients with tunnel phobia (56), to virtual combat scenes in veterans with PTSD (57), in a virtual bus trip in patients with panic disorder (58), and in response to a virtual audience  in  social  anxiety  (59).  In  the  tunnel  phobic  patients  group,  self-reported  anxiety  was  measured  by  means  of  the  subjective unit of discomfort scale (SUDS) (60). Both the self-reported  anxiety  and  heart  rate  increased  with  the  transition  of an open to a tunnel VR-environment. The skin conductance level  was  higher  compared  to  healthy  controls  in  all  environ-ments (56). The veterans with PTSD showed a slower decrease in skin conductance amplitude compared to healthy controls in the course of five virtual combat scenes, possibly indicating slower habituation.  No  correlations  between  the  physiological  meas-ures and the self-reported anxiety and PTSD-related question-naires were determined (57). During a virtual bus trip, patients with panic disorder had higher scores on self-reported anxiety (SUDS),  panic  attack  symptoms  (diagnostic  symptom  ques-tionnaire)  (61),  and  physiological  anxiety  measures  compared  to  healthy  controls  (58).  Cornwell  and  colleagues  investigated  patients with social anxiety in a virtual public speech setting by means of startle reactivity as a physiological anxiety measure in addition to self-reported levels of distress on a VAS. They found significantly  higher  self-reported  anxiety  and  startle  reactivity  in response to focused attention of the audience (59). In all these studies,  the  physiological  anxiety  measures  are  heterogeneous  but generally in line with the self-reported anxiety measures.Finally,  the  research  group  of  Kim  et  al.  developed  a  virtual  house  and  office  for  the  assessment  of  both  anxiety  and  com-pulsions  in  obsessive–compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  (62, 63). They  found  a  higher  level  of  provoked  anxiety  (VAS)  before  and  after  checking  a  situation  in  OCD  patients  compared  to  healthy controls, and a larger decrease in anxiety after checking. Furthermore, a correlation of VR-anxiety with the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (64) and Beck’s Anxiety Inventory  (65)  was  found  (r=  0.35, p<  0.05  and  r=  0.45, p< 0.01). They also found OCD patients showed a higher check-ing frequency, spent more time on checking, a longer trajectory in  the  environment,  and  more  gazing  time  during  checking  behavior.  The  Y-BOCS  was  correlated  with  both  gazing  time  (r= 0.48, p< 0.05) and checking time (r= 0.51, p< 0.05).DiSCUSSiONThe  primary  purpose  of  this  review  was  to  investigate  whether  VR environments used in the assessment of psychiatric disorders were  able  to  show  a  relevant  difference  in  outcome  measures  between patients with a psychiatric disorder and healthy controls. Generally, the virtual environments were able to show significant differences  in  outcome  measures  between  patients  and  healthy  controls. This highlights the great potential of VR in a psychiatric assessment. Only in two studies on emotion recognition in autism and paranoia in psychosis (10, 32), no significant differences were found between patients and healthy controls, probably due to small sample sizes or clinical groups with relatively mild symptoms.The  results  on  the  use  of  VR  in  the  assessment  of  psychotic  disorders  show  virtual  environments  are  capable  of  provoking  paranoid  ideations  and  assess  deficits  in  social  behavior  and  cognitive  disabilities  in  patients.  This  shows  great  potential  for  the assessment of a population that might be more at ease with a computerized assessment than a face-to-face assessment with a clinician. From the studies on VR in ADHD and autism, it is clear that the inclusion of parameters such as hyperactivity measured by tracking devices and neural mechanisms measured by fMRI is of value. If a virtual environment is able to activate both subjective symptoms and the neural and physiological substrate associated with a disorder, this can contribute to a more comprehensive and objective  assessment  of  this  disorder.  For  children  with  ADHD  and  autism,  the  implementation  of  VR  to  assess  symptoms  would  provide  a  more  realistic  and  immersive  experience  than  current  laboratory  settings,  possibly  contributing  to  increased  motivation  and  participation.  In  forensic  psychiatry,  VR  pro-vides  the  opportunity  to  expose  offenders  with  a  psychiatric  disorder  to  potential  risky  situations  in  order  to  evaluate  their  symptoms,  without  posing  an  actual  threat  to  the  environment  (66). Therefore, although research in this area is scarce, forensic psychiatry  has  great  potential  for  VR  assessment.  In  substance  use  disorders  pertaining  the  misuse  of  alcohol-  and  cannabis,  VR seems to be an adequate technique to provoke craving. The addition of olfactory stimuli complements the experience in VR. However,  studies  on  other  substances  including  hard  drugs  are  necessary  before  definite  conclusions  can  be  drawn.  In  eating  disorders, VR has the potential to assess both key symptoms like a  deviant  body  image  and  additional  symptoms  like  anxiety.  In  these  studies,  only  virtual  food  or  dining  scenarios  were  used  to  provoke  symptoms.  It  would  be  interesting  to  explore  more  possibilities,  for  example,  by  assessing  body  image  in  relation  to  avatars  with  various  body  shapes.  The  use  of  VR  in  anxiety  disorders  is  promising  since  physiological  mechanisms  of  the  anxiety  response  are  largely  known.  This  enables  the  inclusion  of  physiological  measures  such  as  heart  rate,  respiration  rate,  and skin conductance in response to a virtual environment, thus contributing to an objective assessment of anxiety (67).Efforts are made to create VR environments to assess multiple symptoms  of  a  disorder;  the  study  of  Rizzo  evaluated  the  most  comprehensive VR environment, evaluating both cognitive func-tions like attention and distractibility and physical activity, which are core symptoms of ADHD (28–31). However, in most of the reviewed  studies,  VR  was  used  to  assess  only  one  symptom  of  the specific disorder. Interestingly, this could be in line with the introduction of dimensional criteria to the categorical diagnostic classification in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (68).  In  this  edition,  apart  from  marking a symptom as present, dimensions are included to deter-mine symptom severity. It would be worthwhile to investigate if VR  can  be  used  to  measure  the  severity  of  specific  symptoms  transdiagnostically.  More  research  on  the  correlation  between  traditional symptom severity measures and VR environments in patients in different diagnostic categories would be necessary to explore this potential.The second purpose was to determine correlations between VR outcome measures and traditional diagnostic measures in patients with  psychiatric  disorders.  Not  all  studies  included  a  correlation  measurement.  In  14  studies,  significant  correlations  were  found  between  VR  outcome  measures  and  traditional  measures.  The  authors usually expressed a preference for VR because contrary to retrospective traditional measures, in VR, real-time assessments of behavior, affect, and social interaction are possible in response to realistic  environments  resembling  daily  activities  (69).  However,  VR  outcome  measures  were  often  determined  using  symptom  scoring  through  both  state  and  trait  questionnaires  after  immer-sion in the VR environment. State questionnaires are designed to measure  temporarily  induced  symptoms  whereas  trait  question-naires are designed to measure an enduring disposition (70). State questionnaires, like the State Social Paranoia Scale, therefore, seem more  suited  for  this  purpose.  It  could  be  argued  that  short  state  questionnaires obtained during instead of after the VR experience are more objective, though this might disturb the immersion in the virtual environment. The objectivity of a VR measurement can be further improved when other measures are added, such as physical activity,  eye  tracking,  distance  tracking,  physiological  measures,  and  neural  activation.  These  measures  can  often  be  obtained  without  distracting  the  participants  so  the  immersion  in  the  VR  environment is not disturbed. The addition of these measures con-tributes to a more objective assessment of the psychiatric disorder.Since this literature review concerns a novel technique, which has only recently been investigated in the psychiatric diagnostic process, sample sizes of the included studies are generally small. Furthermore,  only  publications  in  the  English  language  have  been included in this review. Due to the great variety in investi-gated virtual environments and outcome measures, merging the results was not possible. More studies with larger sample sizes and more uniformity in outcome measures are necessary to enable a more systematic review including a meta-analysis. Not all studies reported  results  on  correlations  between  the  VR-measures  and  traditional  measures  of  the  aspect  of  the  disorder,  presumably  because  of  small  sample  sizes  or  absence  of  comparable  assess-ment methods. This impairs a conclusion on construct validity.In conclusion, VR shows potential to be implemented in the diagnostic  process.  The  advantages  are  numerous  and  include the use of an immersive, modern technique instead of a standard laboratory  setting  that  could  motivate  participating  patients.  Most of the studies investigated made use of computer-animated VR  environments  with  divergent  levels  of  realism.  New  VR  techniques such as video VR or augmented reality are develop-ing at great speed and will drastically improve the resemblance to  real-life  situations.  This  will  enlarge  the  efficacy  of  virtual  environments  in  assessing  psychiatric  disorders.  Furthermore,  standardized  environments  can  be  created  in  VR  to  ensure  uniformity if the VR is used for research purposes. Finally, the resemblance to real life situations creates enormous opportuni-ties to assess patients in enclosed settings, for example, patients in detention.AUTHOR CONTRiBUTiONSMB, PK, and DD contributed to the conception of this manuscript.

IntroductionChildren have always enjoyed games of “pretend.” While immersed in a game, they often becomedeeply absorbed and able to ignore aversive stimuli. Immersive virtual reality (VR) is a promising andengaging intervention that may help to decrease pain and anxiety for children undergoing painfulprocedures and suffering from acute pain. In the context of their medical care, children may also endurechronic pain and discomfort. Because VR makes it possible to transform how patients perceive theirbodies, it allows other, novel interventions that are possible in no other medium. Beyond providingdistraction and enjoyment, virtual reality may provide a corrective psychological and physiologicalenvironment, and can facilitate rehabilitation for pediatric patients suffering from chronic pain, aswell as neurorehabilitation for children suffering from stroke and cerebral palsy. With the advent ofinexpensive consumer VR systems, the opportunities to research and deploy VR in the clinic haveexpanded. However, the powerful and transformative nature of many VR experiences may also posesome risks and should be utilized with caution in developing therapeutic VR interventions [1].In this paper, we will review recent literature in pediatric virtual reality for procedural pain andanxiety, acute and chronic pain, and some rehabilitation applications. We will also discuss clinically relevant characteristics of VR experiences, such as the aspects of presence, interactivity, customization,social interaction, and embodiment. We will review how each of these requires special consideration,and in some cases adaptation of the hardware or software, for a child population. Finally, we willdiscuss the practical considerations of some currently available consumer VR systems, and offerspecific suggestions and information for clinicians wishing to adopt these engaging therapies.2. Review of Virtual Reality in PediatricsWe conducted a review evaluating articles that describe the use of VR in pediatric procedural,acute and chronic pain. (see Table1) We included articles detailing case studies or randomized trialsof the use of VR. Where such studies were not available, we referred to adult studies that may offerinsights into the potential use in pediatric populations, which are specifically described as pertaining toadult populations. We will discuss the selected articles and themes as they are relevant to the improvedcare of pediatric patients through VR. These articles can be roughly divided into two main areas ofclinical relevance: acute and procedural pain and anxiety, and chronic pain and neurorehabilitation. 2.1. Acute and Procedural PainAcute pain is pain directly related to a temporary injury and typically lasts a short period oftime (<6 weeks). Procedural pain and anxiety refers to distress derived from medical procedures,including intravenous (IV) injections, vaccinations, anesthesia administration, and other needle-relatedprocedures, as well as other procedures required as part of routine care, such as burn wounddressing changes.Virtual reality was first used to manage acute pain during painful repetitive dressing changesin patients with burn wounds [2]. Schmitt et al. demonstrated a reduction in pain of 27–44% inpediatric patients who participated in the virtual environment featuring a wintery scenario, called“SnowWorld”, while undergoing dressing changes [3,4]. Jeffs et al. corroborated the efficacy of VR inburn wound pain management in adolescents [5]. In a randomized three-armed trial, 30 adolescentswere assigned to standard care, watching a movie, and VR engagement with the “SnowWorld” virtualenvironment. The VR treatment group reported a decrease in pain compared to the passive distraction(movie) group, (difference 23.7 points decrease in pain score out of 100 total), 95% confidence interval(CI): 2.4–45.0,p= 0.029). In comparison to standard care, the VR group showed decreased pain aswell, though the difference was not statistically significant. Of note, the VR group was the only one inwhich the patients’ pain during the actual dressing change procedure was reported to be less than thepre-procedure pain [5].Brown et al. performed a randomized controlled trial of an interactive VR intervention entitled“Ditto” and showed not only a decrease in self-reported pain and anxiety in pediatric patientsundergoing dressing changes, but also an increased rate of epithelialization and faster wound healing inthose patients undergoing VR intervention for their procedures (−2.14 days (wounds healed 2.14 days faster), CI:−4.38 to 0.1,p= 0.061), which was significantly faster when adjusted for mean burn depth(−2.26 days, CI−4.48 to−0.04,p= 0.046) [6]. Lastly, Miller et al. showed that not only was painreduced during dressing changes, but when a multimodal intervention was utilized, the procedurerequired less time to complete (p< 0.05) [7]. Additional notable studies investigating the efficacy ofVR distraction on pain and anxiety in children and adults undergoing severe burn wound care arereferenced below [8,9].Virtual reality has also proven successful at lessening procedural pain and distress related to IVplacement and other needle-related procedures. In a 2006 study, Gold et al. performed a randomizedcontrol trial on 20 pediatric patients requiring IV placement [10]. The VR group received a multisensoryVR experience including visual stimulation from a HMD device, tactile feedback, and music, for 5 minprior to IV placement until 5 min after placement. The control group received local anesthetic spray,but no VR intervention for the procedure. They were permitted to utilize the VR equipment for 3 minfollowing IV placement. While children in the control group experienced a four-fold increase in painas measured by the Wong-Baker FACES scale [11], the VR group showed no increase in affective painfollowing IV placement [10]. Nilsson et al. performed a similar study (N= 42) using a screen-basedthree-dimensional (3D) program [12]. Pediatric and adolescent patients undergoing venous puncturesor subcutaneous venous port device insertion were randomized either to this non-immersive VR andstandard care, or standard care alone. Patients did not report a significant decrease in self-reportedpain for either condition; however, they did report that the VR distraction was a pleasant experiencethat succeeded at distraction. (We note that this intervention was not immersive).Beyond VR’s use in acute pain, it can potentially be used to make patients more familiarand comfortable with procedures. Most hospital procedures are accompanied by some stress oranxiety on the part of pediatric patients.  He et al.  looked at the effect of therapeutic play onperioperative anxiety, negative emotional manifestation, and postoperative pain [13]. Ninety-fivechildren were assigned randomly to receive one hour of face-to-face therapeutic play involving objectsto be used in the operation, or no intervention. Those children that participated in therapeutic playexhibited significantly lower levels of anxiety and negative emotion manifestation associated withtheir upcoming operation, and even showed lower levels of post-operative pain [13]. Virtual reality hasthe potential to familiarize children with the operation environment in a safe, controlled and playfulway, and potentially decrease their pain and anxiety.2.2. Chronic PainUnlike procedural or acute pain, chronic pain is persistent for a period greater than six weeks,often for months or years. It may include chronic headache, abdominal, limb, joint or back pain,neuropathic or sympathetically maintained pain such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS),and pain related to other medical conditions. In addition to symptom control, interventions oftenstrive to maintain or improve function and minimize disability. While there is little research on usingVR for the treatment of chronic pain in children [14], promising results in adults indicate that furtherresearch in this area is advisable. Below, we describe the use of virtual reality in neuromodulation,in physical therapy, and in biofeedback. We describe the limited research in children, and attempt toextend relevant research in adults to pediatric patients.Virtual reality may have the potential to amplify the neuromodulatory effects of traditional mirrorvisual feedback (MVF), which can modify patients’ pathological cortical representations in the groupof chronic pain syndromes that includes phantom limb pain, complex regional pain syndrome andfibromyalgia. Mirror visual feedback was first applied to adult patients suffering from phantom limbpain (PLP) by Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran [15]. This technique may exert some of itsbenefits by encouraging the remapping of motor and somatosensory cortices, allowing a return toa homeostatic processing mechanism and facilitating the improvement or resolution of the painfulexperience. Mirror visual feedback was also found to be of benefit for CRPS in a randomized controlled trial with adult patients [16]. Virtual reality has also been used in an open-label case study of fiveadults with CRPS, four of whom reported reduced pain intensity over five to eight sessions [17].Besides providing a new medium for mirror therapy, VR also allows other avatar configurationsto be altered. For example, patients can also experience augmented motion such that a small motion inthe physical world maps to a large motion in the virtual one, or vice versa. Thus, a small movementof the arm made in real life could be rewarded by a larger, more apparent arm movement in VR.Conversely, for patients prone to guarding, movements made by patients in real life could be depictedas more restrained in the virtual world [18], which might encourage such patients to move morefreely. Two studies demonstrated that adult patients with neck pain moved further and reported lesspain as a result of movement when VR was used to reduce their apparent movement [18,19]. In thepediatric population, there is currently one feasibility study exploring the neuromodulatory effects ofVR. Won et al. showed that a VR experience with MVF and movement augmentation properties waswell tolerated by pediatric patients with CRPS during physical therapy sessions [20].The hypothesis supporting the efficacy of neuromodulatory chronic pain therapies is foundedin the association between brain connectivity changes and improvement in chronic pain symptoms.A study conducted by Lebel and colleagues found significant changes in the somatosensory processingof symptomatic pediatric CRPS when compared to post-treatment CRPS patients and controlpatients [21]. Because this processing resumes normality after months of traditional physical therapy,it is possible that directly altering somatosensory processing (i.e., via mirror therapy), might itself behelpful in resolving pain. Becerra et al. and Simons et al. [22,23] both showed changes in connectivityin various intrinsic brain networks after therapies that reduced pain and improved function. It is stillunder debate whether the association of successful recovery from CRPS symptoms is directly relatedto changes in brain connectivity or brain plasticity, and further research is required to determine whatother factors may be involved in remapping somatosensory processing [24]. However, another pieceof evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from graded motor imagery, a therapy that involves theimaginary mental rotation of one’s limbs. Adult studies have shown that this therapy is associatedwith both changes in connectivity in the central nervous system as well as reduction in pain [25], andpediatric patients may also benefit from such therapy.As discussed above, VR offers an engaging opportunity for children to practice motions thatwould be impossible or unsafe in the real world [26]. Especially in diseases like cerebral palsy, wheremotion is difficult, the opportunity to engage in active/repetitive motor and sensory practice canincrease neuroplasticity and allow for learning to overcome some limitations of the disease [27].In a study by Biffi et al., 12 children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) participated in 10 sessions usingan interactive VR system called GRAIL (Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab); treatment sessionsled to improvement in walking abilities and enhanced engagement during training, suggesting thatVR may play a role in the field of rehabilitation [28]. Although not discussing efficacy, Meyns et al.demonstrated the feasibility of using VR training to improve balance in children with cerebral palsyafter lower limb surgery [29]. For a more in-depth review on neurorehabilitation applications of VR,please refer to the following excellent review by Wang et al. [26].In addition to alterations in neuronal representation, patients with chronic pain often exhibita debilitating fear of inducing more pain through movement. This fear not only seriously affectspatients’ ability to function; it can also inhibit physical therapy efforts. Trost et al. discusses the use ofVR interventions to provide graded exposure treatment for pain-related fear and disability in adultswith chronic low back pain [30]. Collado-Mateo et al. also found that a combined program of physicalexercise and non-immersive VR improved adult patients’ mobility, balance, and fear of falling in adultfibromyalgia patients [31]. Senkowski et al. cite significant promise in the use of VR-assisted therapyto aid in the decrease of fear-avoidance behavior and improvement in distorted body images [32].Fear-avoidance is noted to be an issue in the pediatric population with chronic pain [33]; however,no VR interventions have yet been specifically designed to address this phenomenon. 2.3. Other ApplicationsAnother possible application is the use of a virtual pain coach.  A VR experience couldreinforce therapeutic movements and exercises in an out-of-clinic environment. This is especiallyuseful for long-distance patients or patients who are unable to be physically present for otherreasons [34]. The variety of VR therapy options makes it an effective intervention to integrate intoexisting interdisciplinary programs, combining medical treatment, physical therapy and psychologicalinterventions [35].Finally, the effects of VR may potentially be augmented by other techniques such as biofeedbackor hypnosis. Biofeedback is the process of providing the patient with information on his or her ownneurological data such as heart rate variability, temperature, or muscle tension. In a recent pilot study,non-immersive VR mirror visual feedback was used successfully in combination with biofeedback totreat pediatric patients with chronic headaches [36]. Virtual reality was also used in conjunction withhypnosis in an adult case report [37].3. Qualities of Virtual RealityIn the next section, we will discuss five qualities of VR that are of interest in considering clinicalapplications for children: presence, interactivity, social interactions, customization, and embodiment.We will then summarize current research on how these qualities may be useful for treating children,and note some potential areas of caution (see Table2). 3.1. PresencePresence is the subjective feeling that the user is experiencing the environment and interactions inthe virtual world are [38]. It is often measured by self-report, has been linked to physiological processessuch as changes in hear rate and skin resistance [39] and behavioral measures such as not respondingto stimuli in the real world [40]. Feelings of presence can be evoked by even a simple VR system, suchas a 360◦video viewed through a smartphone in a cardboard housing. However, a recent meta-analysisindicates that features such as improved tracking, stereoscopy, and wide field of view can make VRexperiences feel more real [1]. VR is particularly promising as a distractor for procedural and acutepain because of the deep sense of presence created by virtual worlds. The immersive features of virtualreality technology immerse the patient with rich sensory stimuli, creating a realistic experience andeffectively directing attention away from adverse stimuli [41,42].Age may influence how virtual environments are experienced. For example, during burn woundcare treatment with VR, pediatric patients reported higher levels of presence compared to adultsreceiving the same treatment [43]. Experiencing virtual environments as extremely real has importantimplications for how children behave and understand the world after the VR treatment. Baumgartneret al. showed that children’s brains process virtual experiences differently than adults and young children may require different types of immersive experiences [44]. During early childhood (e.g., threeto five-years-old) children’s sense of fantasy and reality is rapidly developing [45,46]. Virtual realitycan create realistic environments that may seem extremely real, particularly to young children.Given that children may be more vulnerable to believing virtual experiences as real, virtualenvironments may need to be carefully selected and contextualized so that children are able tointerpret their memories of the experience as derived from media rather than real life. In addition,for some age groups, debriefing post-VR experience may be necessary.3.2. InteractivityVirtual reality therapies incorporating tracked body movements allow for greater interactivity.In a study examining cold pressor-induced pain in 40 children of age 5–13, greater interactivity ledto greater pain tolerance [47]. Children with disorders requiring intensive physical therapy, such asthose with CRPS [20] or cerebral palsy [48], may benefit especially from interactive VR scenarios. Suchscenarios can encourage them to engage in physical therapy while simultaneously increasing theirpain tolerance.High levels of interactivity, while effective in reducing pain, can be accompanied by a sense ofnausea and increased potential for collisions with objects in the real world. Clinicians using VR astherapy should be aware of these minor risks and take appropriate precautions for pediatric patients.The more immersed users are in a virtual environment, the more the sensory input from the real worldis occluded, and active users risk painful collisions.Even adults can be at risk of falling or colliding with objects; during set-up, consumer VR systemsrequire users to define a safe “play space”, and displays are equipped with safety warnings andreminders to be careful when users approach the edge of this area. As children move around a virtualspace, they may come dangerously close to objects in the real world. Even if children are seated,they should be monitored. Careful spotting is necessary to prevent them from injuring themselves orbystanders by accidentally colliding with real-world objects.In addition, although both children and adults can be prone to “cybersickness” or feeling nauseaor dizziness, children may be less able to anticipate and articulate their discomfort. Caretakers andclinicians will need to be aware of the possible signs of sickness and develop ways to measure children’sdiscomfort in non-verbal and unobtrusive ways such as how children are moving their bodies. Anotheralternative is to set pre-determined timers to take short breaks.3.3. Social Interactions in Virtual RealityMany factors affect children’s and adolescents’ attraction to video games, one being their abilityto share the experience with friends [49]. The use of social interactions may be particularly effectiveduring adolescence, a time in which children are particularly sensitive to social environments [50].Children as young as five years old respond to digital others in social ways, such as using informationfrom a virtual character and a live person at equal rates to solve a decision-making task [51].Children with chronic pain may have particular deficiencies in their abilities to develop andmaintain peer relationships due to increased school absences, decreased physical ability to engage insports or social activities, and decreased mood and motivation [52]. Virtual environments may offeran alternative platform for children to build these relationships by giving them access to near-realexperiences that they can share with others. Children with high medical acuity, such as those inpost-transplant oncology, who may be confined to a single room or unit, may benefit from access tovirtual interactions if they are not able to engage with peers due to their ongoing medical condition.Since older children are already actively involved in virtual environments [53], the presence ofvirtual others offers new opportunities. For example, physical therapists might incorporate theirown behavior into the environment via an avatar, which could help patients visualize or mimic thecorrect movements. However, as in real life, children need age-appropriate environments. Social virtual environmentswhere children can interact with others such as High Fidelity (highfidelity.io) or AltspaceVR(altVR.com) may require additional permissions so that outsiders cannot interact with patients.In addition, the risks and benefits of social media are also applicable when social media platformsprovide opportunities for patients to engage virtually. While Facebook’s current beta application,Spaces (oculus.com/experiences/rift/), and other environments linked with social media platformsmay make it easy for children to engage with Facebook friends in immersive virtual reality, suchinteractions should not allow children to isolate themselves from face-to-face interactions.3.4. CustomizationClinicians or patients themselves can select different virtual scenarios, and as commercial VRexperiences become more common, there will be more entertainment options from which to choose.Allowing children to contribute towards selecting their virtual experience allows them agency and theability to tailor content to their interests, as in a study by Ni et al. [54] in which pediatric patients andtherapists evaluated games for degree of engagement and therapeutic usefulness together. For example,children undergoing chemotherapy who selected from a variety of virtual scenarios demonstratedreduced symptom distress [55].Another area in which customization can be advantageous is in avatar representation. Childrencan select and customize their own avatar, providing them with a sense of control in a clinical settingthat can significantly reduce patient stress [56]. When embodying stock avatars, children may needguidance in selecting age-appropriate material, as research suggests that users may conform theirbehavior to their preconceptions about the avatars they embody [57,58].3.5. EmbodimentWhen body trackers, such as hand trackers, are used in virtual reality, participants can move theirtracked limbs in real life and see their movements represented by the movements of their avatars invirtual reality. Thus, when patients are embodied in an avatar, they gain the sense that their avatarbody has replaced their real body. This allows interventions that are possible in no other medium.The tracking capabilities inherent in embodied VR experiences also offer clinicians the abilityto monitor their patients’ physical movements and quantify rehabilitative effort without relying onself-report data. As wearable monitors for tracking physiological data such as gait and posture becomeincreasingly used, clinicians may observe their patients on multiple levels and tailor their treatmentaccordingly. As with all patient data, movement data in children must be carefully protected.Movement is not the only aspect of patient activity that can be visualized. Biofeedback is one arenathat would lend itself well to the flexibility of virtual reality, allowing the visualization of pain-linkedphysiological signals. This could be particularly useful for children who may not be as adept as adultsat verbally describing sensory information, or translating verbal instruction into action. An example isdescribed in a recent pilot study mentioned above, where non-immersive VR mirror visual feedbackwas used in combination with biofeedback to treat pediatric patients with chronic headaches [56].In VR, patients can also be embodied in novel avatars, or avatars that do not conform to thelimitations of their physical bodies [57,58]. As discussed above, Jäncke et al. propose that childrenmay be more susceptible than adults to developing a feeling of presence in virtual environments, evenin novel avatar bodies [59]. Thus, as with virtual environments, the experience of embodiment in anavatar, especially an avatar that is dissimilar to a child’s real body must be contextualized. Debriefingpost-VR may be necessary. 4. Practical Aspects of Virtual Reality: Hardware and SoftwareClinicians looking to integrate virtual reality into their practice may benefit from the followinginformation about the strengths and limitations of current consumer VR set-ups.At a minimum, virtual reality requires a display in which the user sees the virtual environment. Inthe most common consumer systems, this is done through a head-mounted display (HMD). An HMDis a type of VR headset that displays digital images on two screens in front of the user’s eyes. Inphone-based VR systems such as Gear VR, Google Cardboard or Google Daydream, the HMD consistsof a smartphone wrapped in an inexpensive case with lenses, such that the phone provides both thecomputing power and display. In more powerful VR systems, such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, thecontent displayed on the headset is generated by a desktop or laptop computer certified as “VR ready”by the manufacturer, or, in the case of PlayStation, by a video game console. In all of these systems,the user’s movements are tracked, and the system updates the content that is displayed to the userbased on these tracked movements. Thus, as a child turns her head when looking around a virtualenvironment through an HMD, the content updates on the screens in front of her eyes, just as it wouldin the physical world if she turned her head to look at a different part of the room. Brief descriptionsof some currently available consumer systems are found in Table3.4.1. Tracking MovementTracking users’ movements while they experience VR is a key factor in creating realisticand compelling scenarios [1].  Two kinds of tracking are used in VR: orientation and position.Orientation, shown in Figure1, tracks the user’s head movements and allows her to gaze around hervirtual environment. In VR systems that only have orientation, users are unable to move through scenes using theirown body movement (i.e., walking). Instead, users might navigate through virtual environments usinggaze, touchpad input or other less-embodied navigation techniques. Currently, smartphone-baseddevices tend to track only head orientation. While these systems are more limited in some respects,they are generally portable and self-contained, and require very little set-up time or space to use. Theyare also lighter, cheaper and potentially easier to clean and/or have disposable components, all ofwhich may provide significant advantages when using them for pediatric patients.In addition to orientation tracking, systems can also have positional tracking (e.g., movingforwards or backwards in VR). Position, shown in Figure2, tracks the user’s body and allows him torelocate within his environment. If the user holds hand trackers, his or her hands will also be tracked.This allows the user to interact with objects in the environment using his or her hands, and optionally see his or her hands represented by an avatar’s hands. Positional tracking typically uses externalsensors placed around a room that capture the position of the headset and/or additional trackedobjects. Such systems allow users to walk around in the virtual space. While they increase the level of interaction available, systems with sophisticated trackingcapabilities that include hand trackers tend to be more expensive than those that only captureorientation. While still portable to an extent, more complex systems also require sufficient spacefor patients to safely move around, and the headsets may be heavier. They will also require moreset-up time.4.2. Hardware Issues to Consider for ChildrenAlthough consumer headsets are designed to be adjustable, they can be too heavy or too large tobe easily used by smaller children, as Dahlquist, et al. speculate in their 2009 study [41]. An additionalissue for hospital use is that headsets, along with hand-tracking devices, which come into close contactwith users’ bodies, will need to be cleaned.These issues and more can be easily addressed through modular additions and adaptations to thebasic VR unit, which would allow the technology to be effective in a wide range of clinical situations.Some consumer systems have washable covers to protect the parts of the headset that come into contactwith patients’ skin. Cleansing wipes can also be used on both trackers and sensors. In a 2014 studyon a patient who had burn wounds on his head, a consumer HMD was mounted to an articulatedarm so that the patient did not actually need to wear the device [9]. Very young children may alsoneed the unfamiliar equipment to be decorated or disguised to be more appealing. As one of theauthors has found, by introducing an HMD as a mask with a soft cover designed with a friendlyface, children were more open to wearing the virtual reality equipment [60]. If trends in lightness,portability, and decreased price continue, VR systems are likely to become increasingly better adaptedfor pediatric patients. 4.3. Virtual ContentResearchers seeking virtual content have three options. They may use existing free or inexpensiveconsumer content. They may develop their own content. Finally, they may work with industry partnersfocused on the clinical use of virtual reality. The following section lists some resources available atpress time.Free or pre-existing games designed for virtual reality are becoming increasingly available andmay be an appropriate option, particularly for procedural pain. Such games can be purchased anddownloaded; for example, through the Steam and Oculus libraries. Another type of frequently freevirtual content is 360◦videos, which can be downloaded directly to the device. Some main contentlibraries are currently YouTube360, Within, Jaunt, NYTVR, Condition One, WSJ, and LifeVR [61]. Mostcontent in these libraries consists of 360◦videos, which allow for orientation tracking without muchinteraction. Finally, social interactions in a virtual space can be facilitated using social platforms suchas Facebook Spaces, High Fidelity, AltSpaceVR, etc.Virtual content can be also created for specific clinical purposes using development platforms suchas Unity3D (unity3d.com), Unreal (unreal.com) and Vizard (vizard.com). Researchers seeking to createcustomized content, which might include those investigating rehabilitation or neurorehabilitation,may require specialized tracking and rendering or customization. Such researchers might considercollaborating with university departments, for example computer science, information science, orcommunication departments, or work with existing software companies. Recording one’s ownimmersive video is also an option. Cameras ranging in complexity and price from the hundredsto thousands of dollars allow researchers to record their own video content and prepare it for viewingthrough a phone-based HMD.Finally, there is increasing commercial interest in supplying clinicians with virtual realityapplications. While it is outside the scope of this paper to recommend specific companies, searching for“virtual reality therapy” online will provide a list of suppliers. In addition, it is possible to make somerecommendations for clinicians to take into consideration when working with a supplier. If patientdata is collected as part of treatment, it may raise confidentiality issues. Developers should haveexperience working in a clinical setting. Compatibility with hardware should also be considered,as some application developers use proprietary hardware, while others allow the use of consumersystems. A brief list of currently available free games can be found in Table4, below. While more research is necessary to determine the more complex aspects of VR in pediatric care,VR can be used immediately to improve the quality of life for pediatric patients. A clinician may orderone of the above-mentioned devices to be kept in the clinic and made available to patients who requireone of the procedures described earlier in this review. For example, a child might be given a headsetand immersed in a relaxing forest scene while they are receiving an immunization or IV placement.Alternatively, a child requiring frequent dressing changes, or other painful procedures may chooseto purchase a unit for home use to assist with pain management. A patient with chronic pain mayfind it beneficial to use VR interventions to temporarily alleviate symptoms, or to assist in performingchallenging tasks while in physical or occupational therapy. The number of applications is unlimited,and can be adapted to the individual child’s interests and the clinical therapeutic need.5. ConclusionsIn summary, VR is a promising new technology that offers unique opportunities to modulate theexperience of pain. These opportunities include the management of acute and procedural pain andfamiliarizing children with future procedures via simulation. In addition, extrapolating from currentevidence in adults, we propose that virtual reality may assist in the treatment of pediatric chronic painvia neuromodulation, as well as physical therapy.Given the reduction in cost and increased ease of access, we hope that clinicians will be encouragedto explore the potential of this new modality. While the immediate adoption of VR can already engageand entertain children in a clinical setting with potential therapeutic benefits, continued study ofthe applications and efficacy of virtual reality in the treatment of pediatric pain is needed to betterunderstand the impact upon quality of life for pediatric patients.

For example, VR-based behavioral interventions have been used todecrease acute pain among individuals undergoing painful medical procedures (e.g. woundcleaning of burn injuries [14,15,22,10], urological endoscopies (36)), physical therapy (e.g.for blunt force trauma [16], for burned skin [12,13]), and dental pain [11,5], andexperimental pain in healthy volunteers (e.g. thermal pain) [17,18]. Although these datasuggest that VR has promise as a tool to help reduce acute pain, there has been limitedinvestigation on the use of VR in the treatment of patients with persistent pain.\r\nThe purpose of this topical review is to identify and highlight ways in which VR can be usedeither alone or in combination with other treatments for persistent pain. The review isdivided into three parts. First, we briefly describe VR methods currently used in themanagement of acute pain. Second, we discuss several potential applications of VR as abehavioral intervention for persistent pain. Third, we highlight important future directionsfor research in this area.Virtual Reality for Acute Pain: Previous ResearchVR-based behavioral interventions have been used in acute pain management for over adecade [12]. VR-based interventions often have been developed as an adjunctiveintervention designed to distract patients from acute pain that has not responded toconventional approaches (e.g. opioid medications) [10,14,22,13]. The rationale for usingVR-based distraction for acute pain is that since pain requires conscious attention, VR drawsattention into the computer-generated world, leaving less attention available to processincoming pain signals.In most VR approaches to acute pain management, an immersive virtual environment isselected that is likely to divert attention away from acute pain such as Snow World [10,22].In Snow World, patients can use a computer mouse to maneuver around and interact with(e.g. by throwing snowballs at snowmen, penguins, and wooly mammoths) a snow coveredvirtual environment while listening to music. Display devices that can be used to displayvirtual environments used in distraction interventions can range in complexity and cost fromfully immersive environments such as Snow World displayed in a wide field of view, high-resolution head-mounted display on the high end, to desktop computers using inexpensivepolarized or shutter glasses in combination with stereoscopic projectors or large 3-Dmonitors.Potential Applications of VR to Persistent PainVR for DistractionDistraction methods such as counting strategies, visual distraction, and audio distraction arecomponents of many cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols for chronic pain [20,34].The question arises: under what conditions might VR prove particularly useful or necessaryas a distraction method for chronic pain? VR may be particularly useful for individuals withpersistent pain who have difficulty diverting their attention away from or disengaging theirattention from ongoing pain [32].There is evidence that VR can enhance the level of immersion in a distracting environmentand that this occurs even when an individual is experiencing pain (32). Repeated VR trials inwhich a person with persistent pain is exposed in a laboratory to a highly engaging virtualenvironment (e.g. SnowWorld [10]) are one way to build confidence in one\'s ability to usedistraction for pain control. One might expect an enhanced sense of immersion if the VRtechnology uses head, hand, or body tracking to foster interaction with the scene [19]. Newhaptic devices potentially enable one to combine visuals, sound, touch, and smell (olfactorydisplays) that can further enhance a sense of immersion.VR for Pain-related Movement PatternsOne of the major challenges of living with persistent pain is that pain is typically increasedwhen a patient moves the painful body area. The increases in pain that occur duringmovement can be substantial and can lead patients to avoid and become fearful of dailyactivities such as walking, transferring from one position to another, etc [33].VR potentially provides a way of exposing patients to movements that they may avoidbecause of pain or fear. One can also easily move a patient from one VR environment toanother thereby enabling rapid and broad exposure to many different challenges. Alongthese lines, Gromala, et al. [9] have used VR to help patients cope with pain that can occurduring walking. They have developed a virtual walk in which the patient is on a treadmillwhile wearing VR headgear. The patient is watching an avatar that is walking in a slow andmindful fashion through a virtual environment. During the walk physiological responses aremonitored and visual (3D display) and auditory feedback is provided to the patient with thegoal of fostering relaxation and decreasing pain. Araceneaux, et al. [1] also have described aVR device for managing walking-related pain.Recent advances in VR technology designed to accurately simulate walking and stoppingduring interaction with topographical features (e.g. experiencing the slope force simulatingthe grade of a virtual hill) or virtual stair climbing offer the possibilities of enhancing thesense of immersion and presence of such treadmill-based VR walking environments [35,4].VR technology can also be used to simulate movement of specific body parts that the patientis unable to control or avoids using. Cole et al [3] have recently shown VR is an effectiveway to reduce phantom limb pain in both arm and leg amputees, using motion capture frompatients’ stumps to generate simulated motion in a virtual limb. When compared to a controlgroup using basic pain distraction methods, amputees using this VR technology reportedsignificantly lower levels of phantom pain in the affected arm or leg. In a small series ofamputees having phantom limb pains (n=5) VR has been used to provide mirror visualfeedback of movement patterns that reduces pain [26]. Ramachandran & Seckel [31] havesuggested a similar approach could be used to treat persons with fibromyalgia whoexperience pain during movement.Integrating VR with Other Behavioral InterventionsVR also can be combined with other behavioral interventions that are currently being usedto treat persistent pain. The behavioral intervention that has received the most attention inVR pain research is hypnosis. David Patterson [29] pioneered the use of hypnosis deliveredvia a VR environment in the treatment of pain. In a case study of a patient having a severeburn injury, he found that a VR hypnosis protocol reduced pain by up to 40%. A subsequentseries of 13 cases of patients with burn injuries by this group [30] found the VR hypnosisnot only produced substantial decreases in pain and anxiety but also reduce patients\'requirements for opioid medications by 50%. Oneal, Patterson, Soltani, et al. [27] publishedthe first study to test the effects of a VR hypnosis protocol for chronic pain. In this study, theeffects of 33 sessions of VR hypnosis was evaluated in a patient with chronic neuropathicpain who had failed to respond to prior conventional medical treatment. Following VRsessions the patient reported either no pain or a reduction of pain for hours afterward. Alimitation of the study, however, was that one month after completing treatment the patient\'spain ratings had returned to their pre-treatment level. Further research is needed todetermine whether a greater dose of VR or additional training in maintenance strategiescould enhance the long-term effects of this VR protocol.There are several reasons for integrating VR with established behavioral interventions forpain [2]. First, such a combined intervention may be beneficial for patients who fail torespond to a conventional behavioral treatment such as meditation or hypnosis [27]. Second,VR can standardize the presentation of images, instructions, and environmental sounds usedin hypnosis (or other behavioral interventions) for persistent pain [2, 28]. Finally, oncepatients have achieved enhanced pain control via a combined VR/behavioral interventionprotocol, they may be more motivated and more successful with practicing the behavioralintervention on its own in their home environment. Given the promising results of VR hypnosis for acute pain, future research seems warranted to explore other proposed VR/behavioral treatment combinations (e.g. VR in combination with meditation [8] or VR incombination with exposure therapy [24].Future DirectionsVR technologies are rapidly evolving. One of the most promising areas for future study isdeveloping and evaluating tailored VR environments that are optimally effective in paincontrol for a given patient. In the future it may be practical to tailor VR environments on thebasis of visual, auditory, tactile [32] and even olfactory stimuli [6]. Tailoring of VR not onlycould enhance the sense of immersion and presence in the VR environment, it could alsoenhance pain control, thereby making training processes more efficient and more readilyavailable to larger numbers of patients. As costs of VR equipment continue to drop andincreasingly accessible ways of delivering VR become available (e.g. VR delivered by homecomputers coupled with low cost 3D television displays and 3 D input devices), it willbecome more practical to use home-based training for patients having persistent pain.Several key questions remain to be addressed if the promise of home-based VR for paincontrol is to become a reality. First, we need to better understand the mechanism(s) bywhich VR effects pain. If VR primarily works through distraction then efforts should bemade to ensure that the displays used continue to be sufficiently complex and novel. On theother hand if VR works by fundamentally altering the way we think and perceive of reality(e.g. by creating a sense of being present in a different state) then the technology requiredmay simply need to be sufficient to create a sense of immerssion. Second, developmentalresearch is needed to ensure that specialized VR pain control applications work as well inthe home as, for example, a game played on a game console. Much of this work will be atthe human-computer interface space where methods need to be developed to ensure that VRapplications work as well at home as in lab settings. There may also be challenges on thehardware side, though new technologies may help. For example, Microsoft Kinect is a new,camera-based VR input device that is unobtrusive and eliminates the need for wires andgloves. New displays such as autostereoscopic displays (no glasses needed) are likely toprovide a more user friendly component that is much less prone to breaking, running out ofbattery power, or otherwise causing problems that could disrupt home-based VR training.There is clear need for studies to help develop and refine VR protocols for managingpersistent pain. First, the efficacy of VR in different populations of persons having persistentpain needs to be determined. The efficacy of VR for persistent pain may vary across agegroups. Recent evidence indicates that older adults report lower ratings of pain whenexposed to pain while being presented with an immersive VR protocol [21]. Third, newsoftware technologies are needed to support the creation of custom environments. New 3Dmodeling and VR design software may be developed with the goal of making designingcustom VR therapies as easy as sketching a storyboard and related 3D models, perhaps as inthe style of Google SketchUp (http://sketchup.google.com/).One important research issue is how to enhance generalization of treatment effects from aVR environment to daily situations in which pain is a problem. Several strategies could beused. First, lab based (or home based) VR training could be combined with a \"moreportable\" behavioral intervention. Second, one can now construct a 3D stereoscopic VRdisplay for a smartphone that can be linked to customizable VR software (http://projects.ict.usc.edu/mxr/diy/) that could potentially be adapted for use in pain management.Finally, in VR one can directly expose patients to progressively more difficult pain-relatedsituations inside the clinic in order to foster more adaptive coping responses to pain.In summary, research on VR interventions for persistent pain is in its infancy. Thistechnology, however, holds considerable promise. It is our hope that pain researchers andclinicians will more actively pursue research and clinical efforts so that this promise may berealized.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Vicky Gandhi and Sarah Rowe for their help in preparing this manuscript forsubmission.

To date, no systematicreview has been conducted on the useof VR in the inpatient medical setting.Herein, we review controlled studies evaluating the utility and efficacy of VR-based treatments for patients admitted to hospitals or rehabilitation centers.VR and its use in healthcare.VR refers to the interactions between an individual and a computer-generated environment stimulating multiple sensory modalities, including visual,auditory, or haptic experiences.9Theuser’s perception of reality is facilitatedby the use of head-mounted displays (HMDs, in goggles or headsets), wall projectors, and/or gloves fitted with sensors or touch-sensitive motors.Sensors may allow researchers to monitor and record a patient’s level ofinteractivity (known as “immersion” or“presence”) in a way that is reliable,safe, and replicable.3VR’s immersive, entertaining effects are useful for redirecting the patient’s attention away from painful treatment experiences and reducing anxiety,discomfort, or unpleasantness.12VR has been utilized in many studies to distract(often pediatric) patients during wound redressing in burn care, and in exposure therapy for phobias or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a substitute for imagination of a feared environment.7VR has been used to treat eating disorders and obesity, allowing patients to improve body image perceptions and promote healthier eating habits by inhabiting realistic avatars in stress-inducing virtual situations, such as food shopping.7VR is also used for patient motor rehabilitation, aiding patients to reacquire specific skills and improve body movement in virtual environments that are less dull or discouraging than standard gym exercises.METHODSLiterature search strategy.Wereviewed all controlled trials of VR ininpatient medical settings published overthe last 10 years. We used PsycINFO,PubMed, and Medline electronicdatabases to identify studies from 2005to 2015, based on the followingkeywords: virtual reality, VR therapy,treatment, and inpatient. We alsoreviewed reference lists of previousreviews and meta-analyses to identifytitles not captured in our initial search.We excluded trials with no control orcomparison group, case studies,outpatient studies, theses ordissertations, and articles not publishedin the English language. As displayed inFigure 1, our initial search yielded 2,024citations of journal articles written inEnglish over the last decade. Wediscarded 1,966 citations not involvinginpatient populations and reviewed theremaining 58 studies in more detail. Weexcluded 42 of these studies because they did not meet all inclusion criteria,were duplicates, or because the full text was not available. We grouped the final11 eligible studies based on their application of VR to three broad medical conditions: pain distraction, eating disorders/obesity, and cognitive/motor rehabilitation. These studies are described in Table 1. Evaluation of study quality.To evaluate the strength of scientific evidence reported in these studies, we utilized a measure developed by Reisch,Tyson, and Mize, chosen among several measures reviewed and approved by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).13,14We selected the Reisch measure because it can be used for both observational studies and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and thoroughly assesses many important domains, including the following: study purpose, experimental design, sample size determination, description and suitability of subjects, randomization and stratification, usage of control/comparison group, treatment procedures, blinding, attrition, subject and treatment evaluation metrics, data analysis and presentation, and treatment recommendations. The measure aggregates data on 34 attributes within these 12 domains to produce a quality ratio (0–1), and can be adjusted to exclude attributes that do not apply to a given study. For example, blinding to the usage of VR is impossible by design, so this domain was not included in our evaluation of study quality.Two raters (study authors JR andMR) scored each VR trial, utilizing a subset of applicable questions that totaled 27 points. After each rater completed a review of one of the VR trials, the raters conferred and discusseddifferences in scoring. Then, each raterreviewed the complete set of articlespresented herein.15We assessed inter-rater reliability by computing Cohen’s Kappa statistic.16Because of theapparent heterogeneity of studies andinconsistency of reported results, weopted not to conduct a meta-analysis.RESULTSOverview.We identified 11 controlledstudies of medical inpatients for thecurrent review, but only eight studiesrandomized patients to VR conditions, orrandomized the order of delivery of VRor standard interventions usingcrossover designs. We observed thatstudies were heterogeneous with regardto targeted disease state, VR equipmentand intervention materials, andoutcomes assessed. Thus, wecategorized results within eachapplication of VR to medical inpatients. Study quality.Studies varied in termsof quality (average quality score=0.87;standard deviation [SD]=0.06;range=0.78–0.96).13The raters were instrong agreement on most study qualitydomains assessed (Cohen’s κ=0.84). Nostudies defined the magnitude of theoutcome to be evaluated (e.g., a 20%drop in pain GRS scores) or explicitlydiscussed cost-effectiveness, althoughfour studies did consider VR devicecost.15,17–19Five of the 11 studies usedsmall samples (i.e., n<30), as expectedin a novel technology efficacy trial.19–23Notably, the lowest rated study(Patterson et al21) and the highest ratedstudy (Schmitt et al15) were authored bymembers of the same study team.15,21Lower quality studies utilized smallersamples, did not randomize participants,and did not consider all factorsassociated with treatment (e.g., cost,adherence, side effects). Higher quality studies conformed to the expectedstructure of an RCT, justified and utilized larger samples, and considered patient side effects. We observed no temporal patterns in study quality, and found no associations between targeted disease state and quality score.Pain distraction.As shown in Table1, VR is used for pain management in inpatient populations more commonly than for other applications. Most researchers utilized the SnowWorld VRsystem (University of Washington HITLab and Harborview Burn Center,Seattle Washington)—the first VR software created for pain control during burn wound redressing—consisting ofan HMD through which patients view and interact with snow-themed characters and throw virtual snow ballsat approaching snowmen via a computer mouse or keyboard.20,24In a first-of-its-kind study of burn victims using SnowWorld, Hoffman et al20observed a41-percent reduction in pain in the VR condition versus a control group, as well a strong negative correlation between self-reported “immersion” in the VR environment and pain ratings. Schmitt etal15observed significant reductions in cognitive pain (time spent thinking about pain, reduced 44%), affective pain(emotional unpleasantness, reduced32%), and sensory pain (reduced 27%),as well as highly positive feelings toward the VR intervention (which many labelledas “fun”). Carrougher et al17alsoobserved reductions in pain unpleasantness (31%), time spent thinking about pain (31%), and worstpain experienced (27%) in VRconditions, but did not observestatistically significant improvements inrange of motion (ROM) physical therapy,which consists of assisted exercisesdesigned to help patients gainmovement in affected body segments(e.g. hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, knee,or ankle). A study by Patterson et al21assessedthe analgesic efficacy of virtual realityhypnosis (VRH), a new procedure inwhich the hypnotist verbally expressessuggestions that focus the patient’sattention away from pain. Based onscores obtained both immediately afterthe interventions and eight hours later,VRH patients reported lessunpleasantness and less pain intensitythan both control groups (VR withouthypnosis, or standard analgesictreatment alone). Two studies of burn patients utilizinglow-cost, easily accessible andaffordable VR HMD systems (Z8003DVisor, eMagin, New York, New York)and off-the-shelf software computergames did not report significantdifferences in self-reported painmeasures or anxiety (see Table 2 fordetailed descriptions of scales used).Morris et al19compared adult burnpatient exposure to VR (video gamesplus analgesics) to a control condition(analgesics alone) and found amarginally significant difference in painreduction between conditions (p=0.06),but no significant decreases in self-reported anxiety. In the Kipping et alstudy,18patients did not report decreasesin pain during burn wound redressing,but nursing staff observed significantreductions.One study utilized wall projectionsand motion detection instead of HMDsto examine the effectiveness oftherapeutic play for reducing depressivesymptoms in pediatric oncologypatients.25After a week of treatment,children in the experimental groupreported significantly fewer depressivesymptoms than those in the controlgroup, but they did not report significantdifferences in state anxiety. Eating disorders (EDs) and obesity.Two recent studies investigating theefficacy of VR treatment in populationswith EDs are presented in Table 1. Cesaet al26assessed the brief and long-termefficacy of VR plus cognitive-behavioraltherapy in a group of 90 female patientswith obesity at an inpatient rehabilitationclinic. In the VR treatment arm,participants wore HMDs and navigatedthrough 14 different virtualenvironments. Patients were exposed totempting situations (e.g., buying unhealthy food at the supermarket) to improve self-control and motivation, aswell as situations that challenged negative body image (e.g., swimming pool). Although improvements in body satisfaction were reported in all study conditions, only patients in the VR condition reported improved body image perceptions at five-week follow-up. After one year, VR patients were significantly better (44.4%) at improving or maintaining weight loss than patients in control conditions (10.4%). Manzoni et al27demonstrated that both VR and imagination-based relaxation training conditions helpedreduce emotional eating, anxiety,depressive symptoms, and self-efficacy(see Table 2 for scales used). However, ata three-month follow-up, the VR condition—wherein patients wandered inan idyllic mountain landscape—demonstrated greater efficacy in reducing emotional eating than control conditions.Cognitive and motor rehabilitation.In a study by Larson et al,23patients of all ages with traumatic brain injuries (TBI)completed 12 four-minute-long cancellation exercises using a system called Virtual Reality and Robotic Optical Operations Machine (VRROOM[developed by Patton et al38]; See Table2) over a period of two days.23Theauthors observed improvements in memory and attention across trials as measured by target acquisition times.Distractions involving both visual and haptic stimuli were especially effective.Also, in a study by Yin et al,22strokepatients utilized the Sixense VR system(Sixense, Los Gatos, California), are habilitation gaming software consisting of an avatar on a screen that is synchronized with the patient’smovements.22In a virtual environment,users are instructed to pick fruit from ashelf and release it into a basket as manytimes as possible within a two-minutetime frame. The authors observedimproved sensorimotor function for bothVR and non-VR (conventional physicaltherapy) conditions, as measured by theFugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA; see Table2), though no significant differenceswere found between conditions. Patient satisfaction and side effects.Patient satisfaction and side effects aredisplayed in the “SecondaryObservations” column in Table 1.Participants often rated VR sessions asmore fun, more immersive, more useful,and more enjoyable than non-VR conditions.15,20,22Despite previous findings that HMDs or peripheral devices often restrict movement, no such results were found in the present review.28A majority of studies did not report VR side effects, such as motion sicknessor fatigue, as factors negatively influencing patient satisfaction or the efficacy of VR treatments. When asked,patients in the study by Kipping et al17did not report experiencing nausea, and97 percent of patients in the sutdy by Carrougher et al18reported no to mild nausea after using HMDs. Yin et al22found no significant side effects, and deemed VR technology feasible and safefor participants. However, in the Larsonet al23study of 18 patients with TBI,three participants dropped out due to fatigue and eye pain caused by the VRROOM system (Table 2).DISCUSSION In contrast to previous reviews of case reports and observational evidence,the present review focused on controlled studies that describe applications of VR technology in the treatment and rehabilitation of medical inpatients.29,30Data from 11 eligible studies provide insight into three current medical applications of VR technology: pain distraction, eating disorders, and cognitive/motor rehabilitation.Pain distraction.VR is particularly useful as a pain distraction that supplements or replaces traditional pharmacotherapies. According to Wiederhold,7pain perception is dependent on a patient’s capacity to attend to a certain stimulus. Thus, pain management may be achieved byblocking sensory information via opioidanalgesics or by creating a distractionfrom pain by immersing a patient in avirtual environment.11,31Previous studieshave demonstrated that opioidanalgesics may lead to undesirableconsequences, such as nausea,increased length of hospitalizations, andinadequate pain alleviation.32VR presentsa useful alternative with minimal sideeffects, although nausea may bereported from either treatment.Five of seven studies demonstratedthat VR is an efficacious non-pharmacologic adjunct to standard opioid analgesic treatments to reduce pain, distress, and anxiety in adult and pediatric patients undergoing unpleasant medical procedures. Highlighting the psychological components of pain, VR distraction treatments reduce self-reported unpleasantness, time spent thinking about pain, and levels of worst pain experienced.15,17These patient-reported observations are corroborated by neuroimaging studies that have highlighted five brain regions showing reduced activity during VRinterventions—thalamus, insula, primaryand secondary somatosensory cortices,and the anterior cingulate cortex.17Overall, both physiological andpsychological measures suggest that VRis a helpful clinical tool in paindistraction. EDs and obesity.VR is used in eatingdisorders to improve patient body imageexperiences, increase self-efficacy, andpractice healthy decision-making.7Participants may navigate a virtualsupermarket to make healthy foodchoices or they may be encouraged toadopt less harmful perceptions of bodyimage through repeated exposure toimages of diverse body types.1Inconjunction with other psychologicaltherapies (e.g., graded exposure orcognitive-behavioral therapy), patientsdevelop skills that carry over into thereal world. VR therapies are useful not only forreplicating a desired environment, butalso for altering reality (e.g., an avatarthat no longer resembles the patient).9This strategy is consistent with Bem’s(1972) self-perception theory,39which postulates that “individuals developattitudes by observing their own behaviorand concluding what attitudes must havecaused them.” Observing an avatar’sappearance as different from the actualself may shape and change the patients’own attitudes—a phenomenon known asthe Proteus effect.40This strategy hasbeen especially successful in thetreatment of body dysmorphic disorder,binge eating, and anorexia.7As reviewedherein, use of virtual environments, pluslow-calorie diets and exercise, led tosignificant improvements in body imageconcerns, weight loss, and bodysatisfaction while also reducing anxietyand emotional eating.26Additionallongitudinal studies must be conducted inorder to assess the long-term efficacy ofVR interventions in preventing weightgain. Cognitive and motor rehabilitation.VR also presents a novel rehabilitationapproach for patients with strokes,Parkinson’s disease, and brain injuries.7VR training allows for high ecologicalvalidity in a safe and controlledenvironment, provides immediate visualand tactile feedback about the individual’sspecific performance, and may boostmotivation.33–35Experimenter-manipulatedenvironments allow for individualizedtraining to enhance specific skills andneuroplasticity through repeated practice,as well as a means of helping patientsovercome underutilization of limbs.28Theintervention studies reviewed hereinconsisted of repeated safe practice ofparticular skills with the help ofsuperimposed virtual limbs that trainindividuals in tasks specific to theirmedical condition. Inconsistent resultssuggest that further testing of VR in motorand cognitive rehabilitation is required.22,23Limitations.We only included 11controlled trials in medical inpatientpopulations, and did not consider othersuccessful case studies or efficaciousoutpatient interventions. Because of theheterogeneity of this small number ofstudies, we could not conduct a formalmeta-analysis. Additional studies will needto be conducted to assess the efficacy ofVR fully.Future research. Whereas earlystudies of VR utilized costly platformsprecluding widespread use, more recentversions are available at price points thatgreatly improve affordability andaccessibility.36In the present review, twostudies using low-cost off-the-shelfHMD visors did not report significantpain reductions.18,19Future researchshould further examine whether thequality of HMD technology is associatedwith improved efficacy. Future studies of VR in medicalinpatients should utilize larger samplesassessed over time to investigate long-term effects.37Although most VR studiesare found within hospital settings, someclinicians predict VR will be used ashome-based rehabilitation in the future.According to Sandlund, McDonough andHäger-Ross, interactive computer playand VR are especially helpful forphysicallydisabled children who areoften treated at home.29In the hospital setting, VR could beused by patients suffering from chronicpain syndromes (e.g., chronicpancreatitis, back pain, and/or refractorymigraines) or used to reduce pain andanxiety in the emergency department(e.g., for reduction of dislocated joints,suturing of lacerations, cardioversion forarrhythmias, or casting of fractures). VRcould also be used as a distraction forpatients undergoing magnetic resonanceimaging or computed tomographyscanning, during interventionalprocedures or hemodialysis, or as partof chemotherapy infusion protocols.CONCLUSIONOverall, a majority of studies from thepast decade found VR to be efficacious,easy to use, safe, and contributing tohigh patient satisfaction. Studies variedin terms of quality, but we observed norelationship between study quality andkey findings. In most cases, patientsconsidered the VR experience to be fun,immersive, and enjoyable, and fewpatients were lost to attrition due to sideeffects.The use of VR in medical fields isrelatively novel but also promising.37It ishighly interactive, flexible, tailored to theindividual, and applicable to peoplevarying in age, sex, and medicaldisorders. As technology improves andcosts are reduced, VR will undoubtedlyshape the future of healthcare.REFERENCES1.Ferrer-Garcia M, Gutiérrez-MaldonadoJ, Riva G.

Awe is a complex and powerful emotion. It can, for example, make us aware ofthe enormity of existence and our relatively small place in it (Keltner and Haidt, 2003;Saroglouet al., 2008). Despite its profundity, awe has only just begun to receive rigorous empirical attention.According toKeltner and Haidt (2003), awe contains two key dimensions: vastness and the needfor accommodation. Vastness involves the perception of enormous and/or complex stimuli, such asa grand view (perceptual vastness) or a big idea (conceptual vastness). The need for accommodationdescribes  how  awe-inducing  stimuli  force  us  to  adjust  our  cognitive  schemas  to  accommodatethem. This aspect may also imply attentional salience and novelty, therefore, at the cognitive level,the need for accommodation component has been related to surprise (Keltner and Haidt, 2003).Specifically, it could be possible to identify a link between the need for accommodation and specificconcepts of surprise (e.g., astonishment), since they can entail the revision of ourwell-consolidatedbeliefs(Lorini  and  Castelfranchi,  2007)  and  because  both  these  emotions  belong  to  the  familyofknowledge emotions(Silvia, 2010). Moreover, awe can have both a positive and/or a negativevalence,  depending,  in  part,  on  how  the  experience  is  interpreted  (Keltner  and  Haidt,  2003) Despite   this  theoretical   complexity,   most   research  focus   onperceptual  vastness  and  on  positive  experiences  of  awe  (e.g.,Griskevicius   et   al.,   2010;   Campos   et   al.,   2013;   Prade   andSaroglou, 2016), while conceptual vastness, negative experiencesof  awe,  and  the  need  for  accommodation  have  only  rarelybeen   addressed   (Shiota   et   al.,   2007;   Schurtz   et   al.,   2012;Valdesolo  and  Graham,  2014;  Piff  et  al.,  2015).  Importantly,while previous experimental studies constructively induced awein  lab  setting,  they  tended  to  evoke  a  low  intensity  versionof  awe.  In  other  words,  awe  experiences  elicited  in  laboratorysettings   have   tended   to   be   somewhat   subtle   (Silvia   et   al.,2015).Here,  we  suggest  virtual  reality  (VR)  as  an  approach  toelicit   awe   in   more   intense   ways   in   laboratory   settings.   VRis  the  combination  of  stereoscopic  displays,  real-time  motion-tracking,   and   stereo   headphones   as   well   as   other   possiblesensory  simulations  (e.g.,  haptic,  olfactory)  to  create  simulatedenvironments.    Thanks   to   its    ability   to   generate    realisticsimulations of real-world experiences, VR has shown effective asmood-induction  procedure  to  elicit  different  types  of  emotions(Riva  et  al.,  2007,  2016b;  Gorini  et  al.,  2011;  Diemer  et  al.,2015).  After  reviewing  these  preliminary  experimental  studies,we argue that VR provides three key assets for improving awe.First, VR provides users with immersive, realistic, and interactiveenvironments  that  can  elicit  a  sense  of  “presence,”  that  is,  thesubjective experience of “being there” while in a simulated reality(Riva  et  al.,  2011;  Waterworth  et  al.,  2015).  Second,  VR  canbe  used  to  generate  complex  vast  stimuli,  which  can  targetspecific facets of awe (Shiota et al., 2007). Third, VR can be usedto  conveniently  track  behavioral  and  physiological  responses,allowing  an integrated  assessment  of the  emotional  experience.We conclude by discussing the potential challenges related to theimplementation of the proposed strategy.RESEARCH ON AWEAwe  is  a  complex  emotion  arising  from  the  perception  of  andneed to accommodate vastness (Keltner and Haidt, 2003; Shiotaet al., 2007), and which is able to impact on several psychologicalsystems.  Thus  far,  awe  has  begun  to  accrue  a  small  researchliterature  investigating  its  aspects.  For  example,  it  has  beenshown that the experience of awe can foster prosocial attitudesas  measured  by  the  percentage  of  money  participants  allocateto others in distribution tasks (Prade and Saroglou, 2016). Awecan  also  influence  beliefs.  Participants  in  one  study  were  morelikely  to  endorse  spiritual-type  beliefs  after  feeling  awe  (VanCappellen  and  Saroglou,  2012).  Awe  also  influences  well-beingand  physical  health  (Krause  and  Hayward,  2015;  Stellar  et  al.,2015). Furthermore, as an epistemological emotion (Keltner andShiota, 2003; Shiota et al., 2007), awe can change people’s generalperspectives toward the world and themselves (Schneider, 2009).Awe  also  has  been  shown  to  effect  the  detection  of  agency(Valdesolo  and  Graham,  2014).  One  study  has  found  that  theexperience of awe changes one’s sense of time (Rudd et al., 2012).Finally,  other  studies  have  explored  awe’s  phenomenologicaldimensions,  identifying  themes  such  as  “fear,”  “connectedness,”“existential awareness,” and “numinous” (Bonner and Friedman,2011; Gallagher et al., 2015).Most   empirical   studies   have   explicitly   referred   to   thetheoretical  model  developed  by  Keltner  and  Haidt  (2003).  Theflexibility of valence in awe is somewhat unusual for an emotion,though there are other examples that follow this pattern, such asnostalgia (Wildschut et al., 2006). Since conventional models ofemotions typically do not admit this degree of complexity (Trnkaet  al.,  2016),  Keltner  and  Haidt  (2003)  suggested  the  existenceof different emotional themes (i.e., threat, beauty, virtue, power,and uncanny) that “flavor” awe (Keltner and Haidt, 2003; p. 304),creating  a  kind  of  family  of  awe-related  states.  For  example,awe arising from threatening stimuli can be a source of negativevalence, as they write, “danger causes an experience of awe to beflavored  by  feelings  of  fear”  (Keltner  and  Haidt,  2003;  p.  304).Finally, supernatural or sublime stimuli, such as an experience ofGod, can flavor awe with a negative or positive component, suchas fear or love (Keltner and Haidt, 2003).Qualitative   research   has   also   been   conducted   on   awe.Thisresearchmainlyreliesoninterviewsinvestigatingphenomenological  aspects  of  awe.  These  studies  have  generallyfound    evidence    for    profound,    intense,    self-altering,    andoccasionally   transformative   capacities   of   awe   (Bonner   andFriedman, 2011; Gallagher et al., 2015).Despite these complexities of awe, experimental research hastended  to  focus  on  only  a  few  parts  of  this  theoretical  model.Indeed,  the  negative  side  of  awe  has  been  explored  by  fewresearches  (e.g.,  Shiota  et  al.,  2007;  Piff  et  al.,  2015).  Further,the  need  for  accommodation  component  has  only  rarely  beeninvestigated,  maybe  due  to  difficulties  in  its  operationalization.Indeed,   Keltner   and   Haidt   themselves   struggled   to   providean   example   of   the   need   for   accommodation   dimension,   assuggested   by   Sundararajan   (2002).   While   few   studies   haveexplored this dimension experimentally a few exploratory studiesoffer promising new directions. For instance, Schurtz et al. (2012)investigated  need  for  accommodation  by  asking  participantsto   remember   a   moment   of   awe   in   their   lives   and   thenmeasuring  different  aspects  of  awe.  They  found  that  the  needfor  accommodation  dimension  did  not  predict  the  occurrenceof  awe  among  participants.  Other  studies  investigated  the  roleof  personality  factors  related  to  the  need  for  accommodation,showing   the   predictive   role   of   Openness   to   Experience   onthe   tendency   to   experience   awe   (Silvia   et   al.,   2015),   theinverse  relationship  between  dispositional  awe  and  the  Needfor  Cognitive  Closure  (Shiota  et  al.,  2007),  and  the  positiverelationship between the amount of awe experimentally inducedand  a  reduced  ability  to  deal  with  uncertainty  (Valdesolo  andGraham, 2014).Negative awe experiences have been shown to be less frequentthan  positive  ones  (Shiota  et  al.,  2007;  Bonner  and  Friedman,2011),  but  this  does  not  justify  the  reduced  research  attentionto the negative dimension of awe (Bonner and Friedman, 2011).On the contrary, recently, some positive psychology researchersexplicitly characterized awe as a Positive Emotion (Griskeviciuset  al.,  2010;  Shiota  et  al.,  2011;  Van  Cappellen  and  Saroglou,2012;  Campos  et  al.,  2013;  Prade  and  Saroglou,  2016).  Mostexperimental  studies  have  considered  awe  according  to  this characterization, which has proliferated in recent years (Bonnerand  Friedman,  2011).  The  negative  dimension  of  awe  needsfurther elucidation.In  sum,  while  awe  is  beginning  to  accrue  a  small  researchliterature,  certain   aspects  of  awe  detailed  in   the  theoreticalliterature  have  been  underexplored.  In  particular,  research  hastended  to:  (i)  emphasize  vastness  rather  than  the  need  foraccommodation;   (ii)   focus   on   positive   rather   than   negativeawe  experiences;  and  (iii)  rely  on  relatively  low-intensity  aweexperiences.  While  the  first  two  issues  need  to  be  addressed  attheoretical level, we contend that VR could provide an effectivesolution  to  address  the  third  challenge,  that  is,  how  to  inducemore intense and ecologically valid awe experiences. Silvia et al.(2015)  argued  that  intense  experiences  of  awe  have  not  beeninduced in laboratory settings, writing that awe experiences seem“too  rare  and  eccentric  to  be  captured  in  the  lab”  (p.  382).These authors called for an integration of different methods anddisciplines that have studied awe, in order to “place the findingsfrom   low-intensity   and   small-scale   lab   research   in   context”(p.382).USING VIRTUAL REALITY TO STUDYAWEA  recent  comprehensive  work  on  existing  literature  on  VRand   personal   change,   reported   the   effective   use   of   VR   inseveral  domains,  such  as  addictions,  anxiety  disorders,  stressrelated   disorders,   depression,   eating   disorders,   and   moodinduction (Riva et al., 2016b). Regarding the latter aspect, virtualexperiences  can  really  influence  our  inner  world,  such  as  theemotional  one  (Dobricki  and  Pauli,  2016).  In  details,  VR  hasbeen  used  to  to  elicit  both  positive  and  negative  emotions.  Forexample,  in  the  study  of  Riva  et  al.  (2007)  participants  wereimmersed  in  three  virtual  parks  designed  to  induce  differentemotional states (i.e., anxiety, relaxation and neutral). Each videowas displayed through a head-mounted device able to track headmovements. Parks shared the same basic structural components(e.g., trees, lamps, band stand) but they differed regarding someother environmental elements such as music, light, and textures.For example, the virtual park intended to evoke sadness was grayand  cloudy,  users  were  alone,  and  sadness-eliciting  music  wasselected  (i.e.,  “Adagio  for  Strings-Choral”  by  Samuel  Barber).The  neutral  virtual  park,  in  contrast,  had  different  music  (i.e.,“Nothing  Spectacular”  by  Michael  Lindh).  For  the  validationphase of each park all participants listened to short history, whichwas different according to the emotional experimental condition(Baños et al., 2004). Findings indicated that virtual stimuli wereable  to  induce  the  expected  emotional  states.  Recently,  thisprocedure  was  replicated  and  further  extended  by  Felnhoferet  al.  (2015)  who  used  five  different  virtual  park  scenarios  toelicit specific affective states. The researchers created virtual parkscenarios  for  joy,  anger,  boredom,  anxiety,  and  sadness,  whichshared the same layout (i.e., non-playing virtual characters; trees;rubbish  bins;  park  benches;  a  pond).  As  these  series  of  studiesdemonstrate, VR allows for the targeted manipulation of certainelements of the environment in order to elicit target emotions.A  first  attempt  to  use  virtual  simulation  to  elicit  awe  wasmade by Reinerman-Jones et al. (2013). These authors analyzedparticipants’ experiences of viewing the earth from a deep spaceperspective – the so called the “Overview Effect” (White, 1987;Yaden  et  al.,  2016)  –  using  a  qualitative  analysis.  In  anotherstudy, Gallagher et al. (2015) induced the Overview Effect usinga mixed reality test environment, in which participants watchedfour  simulations  of  the  earth  or  deep  space  as  if  they  wereastronauts  on  the  International  Space  Station.  Results  of  thisexperiment  showed  that  VR,  along  with  traditional  methods,such  as  autobiographical  recall,  videos,  and  narratives  can  beused together to induce awe experiences. This provides an initial,exploratory study, which we believe can be usefully built upon. Inparticular, we argue that VR presents the following assets for theinvestigation of awe.VR Enhances Presence and EcologicalValidityVirtual reality is a technological system that combines sensorialdisplays  (i.e.,  visual,  auditory)  with  tracking  devices  that  sensethe movements of the individual and report the collected data tothe  visualization  system,  which  updates  the  scene  in  real  time.VR  allows  researchers  to  create  situations  closer  to  equivalentreal ones, thanks to the pictorial realism and the high resolutionprovided  (Coelho  et  al.,  2006;  Parsons,  2015).  Pictorial  realismis  a  function  of  visual  depth  illusion,  which  is  better  providedby 3D virtual environments than by 2D videos on flat computerscreens.  Furthermore,  VR  supports  more  intense  involvementby  users.  The  sensorial  richness  provided  by  VR  describes  thenumber of sensorial channels involved during virtual experiences(Steuer,  1992;  Coelho  et  al.,  2006).  Also,  the  isolation  offeredby  some  VR  devices  can  provide  an  extremely  vivid  sense  ofpresence in the virtual environment (Riva and Mantovani, 2012,2014;  Waterworth  et  al.,  2015).  In  practical  terms,  presenceallows   researchers   to   access   more   reflexive   responses   fromparticipants, as responses are closer to those produced by real-world circumstances, as opposed to those produced by watchinga  video  on  a  screen.  Finally,  Gorini  et  al.  (2011)  showed  thatproviding  a  narrative  with  VR  involving  long-term  goals  andan  engaging  stroyline  promoted  a  fuller  sense  of  immersionin  virtual  environments.  This  narrative  component  is  anotherrelevant  feature  of  VR  to  elicit  stronger  and  more  meaningfulexperiences (Triberti and Riva, 2015).VR allows the Generation of Complexand Vast StimuliAs  mentioned  previously,  complex  and  vast  stimuli  enhanceawe  (Keltner  and  Haidt,  2003;  Shiota  et  al.,  2007).  VR  hasthe  potential  to  generate  such  stimuli  by  delivering  embodiedexperiences that overcome our sense of physics and challenge ourassumptions about the world (Riva, 2016). From a psychologicalstandpoint,  VR  can  be  described  as  an  “embodied  technology”that  is  able  to  manipulate  the  feeling  of  being  and  acting  inthe  world  (Riva,  2009;  Riva  et  al.,  2014).  According  to  theEmbodiment Perspective on cognition, cognitive components ofemotions  are  not  separated  from  the  body,  since  cognition  is derived  from  the  close  relationship  among  body,  environmentand  brain  (Varela  et  al.,  1991;  Thelen  et  al.,  2001;  Beer,  2003).VR, as an embodied medium, allows to manipulate the “cognitivebeing’s   world”   (Colombetti   and   Thompson,   2008;   p.56),   byproviding different perceptual cues to the users and by invitingthe  user  to  build  a  specific  representation  of  the  situation  inwhich she/he is involved. For example, users can experience thevirtual  environment  as  if  it  was  “his/her  surrounding  world”(augmented  embodiment)  or  can  experience  a  synthetic  avatar(user’s  virtual  representation)  as  if  it  was  “his/her  own  body”(synthetic embodiment).For   example,   VR   can   be   used   to   alter   the   perceptualboundaries of the body through the “incarnation” of the subjectin  the  virtual  space  (Riva  and  Mantovani,  2012,  2014).  Forinstance,  participants  could  experiencead  hoc“time  travels”(Friedman et al., 2014). In this case, participants were involvedin  a  moral  dilemma  in  which  they  experienced  a  sequence  ofevents (in this case, the opportunity to stop a gunman from killingothers) in VR from a first person perspective. In the time travelcondition,  people  came  back  to  the  beginning,  and  saw  theirpast  selves’  with  the  possibility  to  change  events.  This  illusionis based on altering participants’ accustomed frames of temporalreference, resulting in an impact on individuals’ moral judgmenton themselves, as well as influencing their actions and choices tosolve the moral dilemma.A   further   example   is   related   to   the   use   of   VR   for   themanipulation ofbodily self-consciousness, that is, the replacementof the bodily self-consciousness with a synthetic one (Riva, 2016).In this approach, VR is used for creating synthetic avatar (user’svirtual  representation)  experienced  by  the  user  as  if  it  werehis/her  own  body.  To  achieve  synthetic  embodiment,  a  space-temporal correspondence between the multisensory signals andsensory  feedback  experienced  by  the  user,  and  the  visual  datarelated  to  the  avatar,  are  required.  For  instance,  Serino  et  al.(2016) invited individuals to embody a skinny virtual body, andfound a decreased estimation of difference between their virtualavatar and their actual body. In other words, people thought theywere thinner after having a virtual experience of being thin.Researchers  can  create  experimental  VR  paradigms  from  anumber  of  unusual  first-person  perspectives  (Rosenberg  et  al.,2013).  In  one  experiment  conducted  by  Osimo  et  al.  (2015),participants switched between a virtual body closely resemblingthemselves  where  they  described  a  personal  problem,  and  avirtual   body   representing   Dr   Sigmund   Freud,   from   whichthey  offered  themselves  counseling.  These  researchers  reportthat  when  the  counselor  resembled  Freud,  participants’  moodimproved  compared  to  when  the  virtual  counselor  was  a  self-representation.  In  this  regard,  VR  could  be  considered  as  asource  of  “epistemic  expansion”  in  the  sense  that  it  providesthe  possibility  of  experiencing  events  that  would  be  otherwiseinaccessible (Gaggioli, 2016).VR as an Integrated Measurement ToolVirtual    reality    can    provide    two    main    ways    of    trackingthe  users’  emotional  awe  responses,  at  both  behavioral  andphysiological  level.  Using  VR,  it  is  possible  to  measure  users’behavior  in  real  time  during  the  experience,  using  motion-tracking  device  systems.  These  devices  allow  tracking  of  head-movements,  upper-limb  and  hands  and  facial-movements,  aswell  as  measuring  posture.  This  information  could  be  used  toanalyze,  for  example,  non-verbal  displays  of  awe.  Further,  VRoffers  the  potential  to  monitor  psychophysiological  correlatesof   awe,   for   example   measuring   Skin   Conductance,   HeartRate,  Skin  Temperature,  and  Respiration,  while  the  participantis   exposed   to   awe   inducing   stimuli,   delivered   through   theimmersive  medium.  More  importantly,  VR  allows  integratingthese behavioral and psychophysiological measurement with theself-reported descriptions of the experience in an ecological butcontrolled  setting  (Wiederhold  and  Rizzo,  2005;  Parsons,  2015:Fusaro  et  al.,  2016).  For  example,  dynamic  stimuli  could  beconveyed to participants trough VR immersive displays, and theirpsychophysiological reactions, as well as their facial movements,or postural ones, could be concurrently assessed and integrated tobuild a more comprehensive model of the emotional experience.POSSIBLE ISSUES CONCERNING THEUSE OF VIRTUAL REALITY IN AWERESEARCHWhile  the  use  of  VR  to  elicit  awe  can  be  promising,  there  areseveral warnings and guidelines that researchers should keep inmind.  The  aspects  of  VR  that  effectively  raise  the  intensity  ofawe  experiences  also  increase  the  risk  of  a  negative  reaction  inparticipants.First,  as  a  note  to  interested  researchers,  some  VR  set-upscan be needlessly expensive. Reinerman-Jones et al. (2013) useda  mixed  reality  simulation  as  a  new  tool  to  investigate  thephenomenological emergent features of awe experience. Indeed,they  were  also  able  to  grasp  an  element  of  surprise,  closer  tothe  need  for  accommodation  component  of  awe  as  well  as  anegatively valenced awe experience by creating a highly ecologicalexperience of awe (Gallagher, 2013). This study provides supportfor  our  argument  (though  they  did  not  quantitatively  measureawe),   nevertheless,   they   adopted   a   very   expensive   solution.However,  new  mobile  affordable  inexpensive  VR  solutions  arebecoming more widely available, as Samsung Gear VR, GoogleCardboard,  and  HTC  Vive.  Second,  VR  can  also  cause  motionsickness.  From  the  user  side,  the  eventual  mismatch  betweenvisual and vestibular information (Reason and Brand, 1975), canbe a source of complaint, and researchers should be aware of itin order to intervene immediately and adequately. The likelihoodof suffering from this kind of disorientation increases if peopleare requested to “walk” into the virtual environment or to standup  for  long  periods  of  time.  Therefore,  VR  should  be  used  forrelatively short periods of time and include a debriefing session,especially if negative emotions were a target.Lastly,    participants    should    receive    adequate    informedconsent   information,   particularly   if   an   emotionally   intensevirtualenvironmentwillbeused.Forexample,somevirtual   environments   intended   to   induce   a   negative   aweexperience   may   become   terrifying   for   some   participants,promptinganadversereaction,insomecasesmaybe  requiring debriefing or even a referral to a psychotherapist. It isimperative  that  participants  are  aware  of  the  kind  and  level  ofintensity of the experience they will undergo.CONCLUSIONAwe  is  a  profound  and  complex  emotion,  which  can  changepeoples’ lives. It can be considered as the core of transformativeand enduring change (Gaggioli, 2016), even though this potentialhas  not  been  fully  explored  in  experimental  research.  Indeed,experimental  research  on  awe  has  constructively  manipulatedawe,  but  awe  inductions  in  laboratory  settings  have  tended  tobe  quite  subtle,  producing  low  intensity  instance  of  awe.  Weproposed VR as one possible solution to disclose awe potential.Several studies support the potential of VR as a transformativetechnology,  able  to  induce  a  personal  change  (Ferrer-Garciaet  al.,  2013;  Garrett  et  al.,  2014;  Den  Brok  and  Sterkenburg,2015;  Riva  et  al.,  2016b).  VR  allows  simulating  both  our  outerand  inner  world  (Riva  et  al.,  2016b),  by  enhancing  individuals’focus on themselves, thus recreating both external and internalcorrelates  of  our  experience,  but  preserving  highest  levels  ofexperimental control and ecological validity. Furthermore, withVR  it  is  possible  to  reproduce  complex  and  vast  stimuli  at  thebase  of  awe  emergence.  Moreover,  VR  allows  for  a  multi-levelassessment of awe that could be useful to catch more awe nuances.Finally,  if  safety  and  effectiveness  recommendations  regardingthis experimental tool are respected, we believe VR can play animportant role in the study of awe as well as other emotions.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthors   contributed   according   to   their   competences   andinterests.

IntroductionThe proliferation of available virtual reality (VR) tools hasseen increased use in experimental psychology settings overthe last twenty years [1–4]. For the researcher, VR is com-pelling due to the almost limitless possibilities for the creationof stimuli and this has led to spread of VR into domainssuch as clinical and developmental psychology, which onemight not have initially anticipated [5–7]. Once consideredto be an “answer without a question,” VR is now firmlyestablished as an experimental tool [8]. However, in additionto the many advantages associated with the use of VR, thereremain some drawbacks and ongoing questions. Of course,the relative importance of these issues is dependent entirelyon the use case; while presence may be important in aclinical setting, for example, issues with space perceptionmaylimittheaccuracyofaphysicalreachtask.Similarly,inthe experimental examination of visual perception, potentialdifferences between actual and virtual reality can either beadvantageous or detrimental. In this paper we provide a briefoverview of the benefits and challenges associated with VR inpsychology research and discuss its utility in relation to theexamination of visual perception.The term VR is often used interchangeably to refer toone of three types of system: a virtual environment presentedon a flat screen, a room-based system such as a CAVE, orahead-mounteddisplay(HMD:[9,10]). Though all threesystems are quite different, a common feature of all threeis the introduction of stereoscopic depth, which creates theillusion that the viewer is seeing objects in a virtual space[11]. This offers a number of immediate advantages to theresearcher: greater control over stimulus presentation, varietyin response options, and potentially increased ecologicalvalidity [12]. This has led to increased use of VR as aresearch tool across many psychological domains such aspsychotherapy [13,14], sports psychology [15], and socialinteraction [16].The most apparent advantage of VR is the ability topresent stimuli in three dimensions. This offers specificbenefits depending on the research domain. For example,when discussing the potential application of VR to neu-ropsychological research, Rizzo et al. [17] describe virtualenvironments as “the ultimate Skinner box,” able to presenta range of complex stimulus conditions that would notbe easily controllable in the real world and enabling theexamination of both cognitive processes (e.g., attention) and functional behaviours (e.g., planning and initiating aseries of required actions). In clinical research VR is usedto create complex scenarios, such as simulating exposureto a phobic stimulus, where the form and frequency of theexposure can be manipulated with absolute precision [4].These examples highlight the difference between VR stimuluspresentation and traditional experimental procedures: in VRthe participant responds to pertinent stimuli while immersedin a larger virtual environment which can itself be controlled.This differs from traditional experimental contexts wherethe pertinent stimuli may be controlled but the surroundingenvironment often cannot be.Ofcourse,ifVRwereonlyavisualmedium,thenitcouldbe argued that its only advantage over traditional experi-mental protocols is the ability to present visual stimuli alonga third dimensional plane. However, as VR technology hasadvanced, many VR research studies now include varying lev-els and combinations of multimodal sensory input, allowingaudio, haptic, olfactory, and motion to be experienced simul-taneously to the graphically rendered environment or objects[18–20].Thisgreatlyincreasestheuser’ssenseofimmersionin the virtual environment and allows the experimenter tocreate protocols that would not otherwise be possible. Forexample, exposure therapy is a common method employed inthe treatment of anxiety disorders which, in the case of PTSD,may be difficult to implement for logistical or safety reasons.To overcome these issues, multimodal VR has been employedto create a virtual replica of a warzone, complete with audioand haptic feedback, to treat PTSD in war veterans [21,22].Where phenomena are known to occur due to a confluence ofsensory data (e.g., audio and visual), multimodal VR enablesthe researcher to manipulate each input separately to gaina more accurate understanding of the relative contributionof each. For example, a recent study by Keshavarz et al. [23]employed this technique to assess the effects of auditory andvisualcuesontheperceptionofvectionandresultantmotionsickness in participants. Finally, multimodal environmentsare associated with faster mental processing times of discretestimulus events, potentially because they provide the userwith more complete information about the environment [24].In addition to the presentation of experimental stimuli,VR enabled researchers to develop new protocols to measureparticipant responding. Many researchers have no doubtlamented the situation where studies that aim to assess acomplex psychological construct (e.g., attention) have, out ofnecessity, been reduced to a mere “point and click” exercisefor the participant. Most experiments strike a difficult balancebetween control and ecological validity, and very few replicatethe multifaceted nature of real-life human responding [25].It has been suggested that VR environments might helpbridge this gap by allowing participants to respond in amanner that is more natural [26]. This can be seen acrossa range of psychological topics. For example, studies onaltruism or prosocial behaviour are often carried out usinghypothetical scenarios and self-report responses [27]. Kozlovand Johansen [2] on the other hand, employed a novelapproach to examining this topic using VR. As participantsattempted to navigate out of a virtual maze, under timepressure, virtual avatars approached the participant for helpin a variety of situations. This enabled the experimenters tomeasure actual helping behaviours, as opposed to partici-pants reporting what they would hypothetically do in such asituation. The researchers argue that even sophisticated high-level behaviours can be successfully examined using VR andsuggest wider adoption. VR environments have also beenused recently to examine the avoidance behaviour, a centralcomponentoffearthatcontributestothemaintenanceofanxiety disorders. While many studies have examined thephysiological and self-report aspects of fear, few have beenable to examine the associated avoidance of, for example,the context or environment that elicits the fear response[28]. Glotzbach et al. [29] were able to directly examineavoidance behaviour by conditioning participants to be afraidof particular virtual environments and recording the extent towhich they avoided returning to those environments later inthe study. Finally, VR could be useful to measure responsesin circumstances where it might be impractical or ethicallyquestionable to do so in real life. For example, Renaud etal. [30] used a virtual environment and avatars to examinesexual affordances of convicted child molesters. The VR setupallowed the researchers to identify specific patterns of gazebehaviour exhibited by the experimental and not the controlgroup of participants. They discuss a number of theoreticaldiscussions that emerged from the study by virtue of the“first-person stance” enabled by using VR.2. Questions about the Use of VRin Psychology ResearchSince many of the advantages of VR as an experimentaltool are derived from the ability to place the participantinside the scene, it is not surprising that a lot of researchhas been conducted into the concept of presence—the extentto which the user feels as though they are “really there”[31,32]. Presence is viewed as crucial to having participantsrespondthesamewayinVRastheywouldinrealitybutremains a difficult concept to measure objectively [32–34].Many studies have recorded user’s subjective experience ofpresence and the perceived effect it has on engagement withtasks in a virtual environment [35–38]. Kober and Neuper[39] attempted to measure presence objectively and posit thatit is characterised by increased attention toward stimuli in thevirtual environment and correspondingly lower attention toVR irrelevant stimuli. They were able to identify distinct ERPpatterns associated with increased presence. Furthermore,[32] found differences in the levels of presence elicited by adesktop VR system and a more immersive single-wall VRsystem, which was characterised by stronger activation offrontal and parietal brain regions, measured using EEG.One of the determinants of presence is the level of immer-sion, described as the level of sensory fidelity offered by theVR system [40]. It has many contributing components suchas field of view, field of regard, display size, and stereoscopy(not exhaustive) and although many use the terms presenceand immersion interchangeably (e.g., [41]), they are verydifferent concepts [31]. Immersion is an objective descriptionof the technical capabilities of the VR system that describesthe level of detail with which a virtual environment can be rendered, while presence describes the user’s psychologicalresponse to said environment. Different users can experiencedifferent levels of presence in environment with the samelevel of immersion, depending on a range of factors suchas state of mind. Still, it seems intuitive that a researcherwould want higher levels of immersion wherever possible, asa higher-fidelity virtual world would elicit more generalizableresponses. Indeed, immersive environments seem to bebetter remembered by participants [37], elicit more intenseemotional responses [42], increase collaboration [43], andmore successfully replicate the anxiety associated with real-life stressful situations [44].Atthesametime,creatinganenvironment elicits a sense of presence that is not entirelydependent on immersion. Factors such as personality andemotional state also influence presence [45–47]. In a researchcontext, realism might not be determined by visual fidelitybut by psychological fidelity: the extent to which stimuluspresentation evokes the type of physiological or emotionalresponse one would experience in real life. While immersionmight help with this goal, it is not the only determining factor[3].Indeed, it is not universally accepted that higher immer-sion is always better with some researchers reporting physicaland psychological side effects from exposure to VR. These arecollectively referred to as virtual reality-induced side effects(VRISE [48]) and often focus on a general feeling of malaiseor perhaps motion sickness experienced by users [49]. Theeffect was initially believed to be caused by limitations in earlyVR technologies where there was often a lag between partic-ipant movements and the display being updated resulting ina disconnection between the perceptual and motor systemsof the user [50]. However, while technological advances haveovercome this early limitation, VRISE remain a problem[23,51,52]. Although common in most VR users, these sideeffects vary from person to person and, as such, it is difficultto pin down what aspects of immersion are responsible.While some studies suggest that more immersive HMDs arelinked to higher levels of sickness in participants [53], otherssuggest that there is little difference between the side effectsof using standard desktop computer display and a head-mounted VR display [54]. Regardless, it seems that thesesymptoms are generally mild and quick to subside and thereis some evidence that users can adapt with repeated exposure[1,55–57]. While not all that common in the literature,researchers should also consider potential psychological sideeffects of VR use, depending on the topic being examined. Forexample, Aardema et al. [58]foundthatuserswhohadbeenexposed to an immersive virtual environment demonstratedincrease in dissociative experience including a lessened senseof presence in objective reality as the result of exposure toVR, while Aim ́eetal.[59] found that VR immersion ledto body dissatisfaction amongst users. As VR environmentsbecome more realistic and scenarios potentially more com-plex, another potential confound may arise from what Yeeand Bailenson [60] term the Proteus effect, where users in aVR environment change their behaviour depending on howthey are represented in the virtual world, though currentlythis effect seems limited to studies that use third-person viewand avatars, as opposed to first person perspective [61].3. The Use of VR in VisualPerception ResearchIn many domains, the benefits of VR stem from the abilityto create recognisable, three-dimensional facsimiles of realobjects in space. As a simplified example, let us imagine astudy that asks participants to attend to the environment andrespondeverytimetheyseeapersonwithahappyface.Herethe researcher needs only the object (face) to be presented, tobe recognised by the participant, and to measure some levelof reaction on the part of the participant. In such a context,the main technical focus in relation to VR is likely to be thevisual fidelity of the stimuli—the extent to which the facescan be detailed enough for participants to distinguish theirex<x>pressions. In the experimental study of visual perception,however, the researcher is concerned with how the stimuli areperceived. Here, VR offers both advantages and drawbackswhen compared with real life and traditional experimentalapparatus. In the following section, we focus on interestingaspects of immersive VR environments that impact how weexamine perception: (1) space and movement and (2) tightercontrol over the visual scene.3.1.TheEffectofSpaceandMovementinVRonPerception.One area where complications arise is in the perception ofspace [62]. Many studies have observed a disparity betweenjudgements of distance and perceptual actions such as reach-ing [63,64]. In addition, it has been found that in VR,users consistently underestimate the size of the environmentanddistancetoobjects[65]. Although not always replicated(e.g., [66]),thiseffecthasbeenfoundtobeconsistentwithbinocular and monocular vision [67], with varying field ofview [68] and even when providing motion parallax andstereoscopic depth cues to the observer [69]. Bingham et al.[62] provide a useful explanation: what we see in VR as anobjectisactuallyaseriesofimagesmediatedbyadisplay.While the user’s vision is focused on the series of imagesthat make up the virtual object, the object itself appears ina different location. As a result, when the user is viewingthe object, there is disconnect between accommodation (thefixed viewing distance between the user and the display) andconvergence(theuser’seyesconvergingonthevirtualobject),two processes that are inextricably linked in viewing objectsin actual reality. Some studies have suggested that this effectis an issue of perception-action recalibration, while otherssuggest that walking through the virtual environment withcontinuous visual feedback is necessary to cause rescaling ofthe perceived space [70].On the other hand, there are instances where the discon-nection between virtual and actual reality provides oppor-tunities for the examination of perception, which wouldotherwise not be possible. Mast and Oman [71]usedavirtual environment to examine visual reorientation illusions,a phenomenon reported by astronauts where the perceivedidentity of a surface is changed due to rotation of the entirevisual field. This phenomenon is difficult to replicate in reallife, as we are surrounded by visual cues in our environmentthat help us to orient ourselves (e.g., trees grow upwards),as well as the orienting force of gravity, which provides a consistent cue for “down.” The authors created an immersiveenvironment (i.e., a room containing various objects) withintentionally ambiguous visual cues so that, due to theplacement of objects in the room, it could appear correctlyoriented even if the room were rotated by 90∘.Theresearcherswere then able to rotate the entire visual scene and examinetheeffectsonperception—somethingthatwouldbealmostimpossible to replicate in the physical environment.In addition to creating new illusions, an immersiveenvironment offers the possibility to examine commonlyemployed visual illusions in new contexts. Traditionally,illusions to examine perception are designed and employedassuming a stationary point of view and have not beenstudied thoroughly for a moving observer. By employing animmersive environment it is possible to investigate whetherthese illusions persist when the observer moves. This wouldbe difficult to carry out using a two-dimensional computerscreen setup, due to the fact that the stimuli, and hence theillusion, require the observer to view the screen head on.Bruder et al. [72] introduced the use of VR to investigate howvisual motion illusions are perceived for a moving observer.The authors manipulated the optical flow—the change ofthe light pattern on the observer’s eyes when moving in theenvironment—and found that optic flow manipulation cansignificantly affect users’ self-motion judgments.Movement can also add ecological validity to the exam-ination of everyday perceptual phenomena. Change blind-ness, a phenomenon in which changes occurring in a visualscene are not noticed by the observer, occurs in a variety ofcontextsanditsimpactisstudiedinrangeofappliedsettingsfrom courtroom eye-witness testimony to driving behaviour[73,74]. Experimental examinations of the effect are usuallydone on a computer screen where two similar images arepresented one after the other with a short blanking betweenthetwo,andobservershavetoindicatewhetherthesecondimage is the same as the first one or if a change has occurred[75]. Using VR to create a more ecologically valid examina-tion of the phenomenon, Suma et al. [76] had the observerwalk through an immersive virtual environment and foundthat even large changes in the surrounding environment wereunlikely to be noticed.3.2. Control over the Visual Scene.Virtual reality technol-ogyovercomesanumberofthelimitationsoftraditionalexperimental methods by enabling precise control of thespatialdistributionofthelightinthevisualsceneaswellasdistance and position of stimuli. In a real room, it is not pos-sible to manipulate these elements completely independently.However, with virtual reality it is possible to manipulate thedistances between the surfaces whilst at the same time main-taining the same photometric relationships (i.e., the amountof light reaching the observers’ eyes remained constant).Furthermore, by manipulating objects in three-dimensionalspace, it is possible to examine the effects of positive andnegative parallax which would not be possible using a two-dimensional screen. Moreover, the VR technology allows fullcontrol of the amount of light reaching the observers’ eyes andof the spatial arrangement of the surfaces in the visual scene.Thislevelofcontrolisparticularlyusefulwhenweexamine colour perception and particular visual phenom-ena such as colour contrast phenomenon [77]. The colourcontrast phenomenon refers to the condition whereby twosurfaceswiththesamespectralcompositionareperceivedtohave a different colour when they are placed against differentchromatic backgrounds. It has been shown that this phe-nomenon depends on perceptual belongingness, the group-ing of a set of apparent elements into a perceived whole [78,79].AsGilchristetal.[80] explained, “When the [contrast]display is presented in a textbook, it is perceived to belong tothe page of the book and to the table on which the book islying. Thus, [...] the illusion should be quite weak” (p. 814).Adopting a VR technology prevents surfaces from outsideof the experimental display from affecting the experimentalexamination of the colour contrast phenomenon. Althoughthe contrast phenomenon has been a focus of centuries ofdebate that has interested scientists and philosophers sinceAristotle’s time [81], there is still no shared consensus of whyit actually happens as some authors attribute its occurrence tohigh-level factors of the visual process whilst others claim thatthe phenomenon is due to low-level factors. In an attempt todisentangle these viewpoints, Soranzo et al. [82]studiedthisphenomenon in VR and provided evidence that the colourcontrast phenomenon may be attributed to the summativeeffect of factors occurring to both high- and low-level factorsof the visual process.4. ConclusionsThe proliferation of available virtual reality (VR) tools hasseen increased use in experimental psychology settings overthe last twenty years. In this review, we outlined the advan-tages and disadvantages of this technology in psychologicalresearch, compared to more traditional apparatus. The advan-tages of VR are that it allows greater control over stimuluspresentation; variety in response options; presentation ofstimuli in three dimensions; the creation of complex sce-narios; the generation of varying levels and combinations ofmultimodal sensory input potentially allowing audio, haptic,olfactory, and motion to be experienced simultaneouslyto the graphically rendered environment or objects; thepossibility for participants to respond in a more ecologicallyvalid manner; the precise and independent manipulationof the geometric and photometric relationships betweenobjects; the possibility of examining sophisticated complexparticipants behaviours, such as avoidance; and the study ofsituations which can be impractical, dangerous, or ethicallyquestionable to be created in real life.Additionally, we suggest that although this technologyhas enormous potential to facilitate new discoveries in psy-chology, there are certain variables that need to be taken intoaccountbytheresearcherincludingtheconceptofpresence—immersion alone is not necessarily sufficient to make theparticipant feel as if the virtual objects are “really there” andrespond accordingly; physical and psychological side effectsfrom exposure to VR (virtual reality-induced side effects). Inaddition, we considered issues that emerge from use of VR inthe examination of visual perception and how comparative ifferences in the perception of colour, contrast, space, andmovement, when compared to real life, can be a concern if thegoal is exact replication of perception in the physical world oran advantage when trying to create “impossible scenarios.”Finally, it is worth noting that there are large variationsin the size and cost of the various apparatus and in somecases they can be impractical for some settings due to theirtechnological complexities. Until quite recently, the priceof immersive HMDs with a good tracker system could beprohibitive. However, HMDs are now becoming cheaperand easier to obtain [83,84], while virtual reality caves, forexample, are still comparatively more expensive and requirea large amount of space to install [9,85]. Nevertheless, VRoffers exciting opportunities and we hope to see future workthat more thoroughly examines the psychometric propertiesof this useful research tool.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interestsregarding the publication of this paper.References[1] L.

To date, no systematicreview has been conducted on the useof VR in the inpatient medical setting.Herein, we review controlled studies evaluating the utility and efficacy of VR-based treatments for patients admitted to hospitals or rehabilitation centers.VR and its use in healthcare.VR refers to the interactions between an individual and a computer-generated environment stimulating multiple sensory modalities, including visual,auditory, or haptic experiences.9Theuser’s perception of reality is facilitatedby the use of head-mounted displays (HMDs, in goggles or headsets), wall projectors, and/or gloves fitted with sensors or touch-sensitive motors.Sensors may allow researchers to monitor and record a patient’s level ofinteractivity (known as “immersion” or“presence”) in a way that is reliable,safe, and replicable.3VR’s immersive, entertaining effects are useful for redirecting the patient’s attention away from painful treatment experiences and reducing anxiety,discomfort, or unpleasantness.12VR has been utilized in many studies to distract(often pediatric) patients during wound redressing in burn care, and in exposure therapy for phobias or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a substitute for imagination of a feared environment.7VR has been used to treat eating disorders and obesity, allowing patients to improve body image perceptions and promote healthier eating habits by inhabiting realistic avatars in stress-inducing virtual situations, such as food shopping.7VR is also used for patient motor rehabilitation, aiding patients to reacquire specific skills and improve body movement in virtual environments that are less dull or discouraging than standard gym exercises.METHODSLiterature search strategy.Wereviewed all controlled trials of VR ininpatient medical settings published overthe last 10 years. We used PsycINFO,PubMed, and Medline electronicdatabases to identify studies from 2005to 2015, based on the followingkeywords: virtual reality, VR therapy,treatment, and inpatient. We alsoreviewed reference lists of previousreviews and meta-analyses to identifytitles not captured in our initial search.We excluded trials with no control orcomparison group, case studies,outpatient studies, theses ordissertations, and articles not publishedin the English language. As displayed inFigure 1, our initial search yielded 2,024citations of journal articles written inEnglish over the last decade. Wediscarded 1,966 citations not involvinginpatient populations and reviewed theremaining 58 studies in more detail. Weexcluded 42 of these studies because they did not meet all inclusion criteria,were duplicates, or because the full text was not available. We grouped the final11 eligible studies based on their application of VR to three broad medical conditions: pain distraction, eating disorders/obesity, and cognitive/motor rehabilitation. These studies are described in Table 1. Evaluation of study quality.To evaluate the strength of scientific evidence reported in these studies, we utilized a measure developed by Reisch,Tyson, and Mize, chosen among several measures reviewed and approved by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).13,14We selected the Reisch measure because it can be used for both observational studies and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and thoroughly assesses many important domains, including the following: study purpose, experimental design, sample size determination, description and suitability of subjects, randomization and stratification, usage of control/comparison group, treatment procedures, blinding, attrition, subject and treatment evaluation metrics, data analysis and presentation, and treatment recommendations. The measure aggregates data on 34 attributes within these 12 domains to produce a quality ratio (0–1), and can be adjusted to exclude attributes that do not apply to a given study. For example, blinding to the usage of VR is impossible by design, so this domain was not included in our evaluation of study quality.Two raters (study authors JR andMR) scored each VR trial, utilizing a subset of applicable questions that totaled 27 points. After each rater completed a review of one of the VR trials, the raters conferred and discusseddifferences in scoring. Then, each raterreviewed the complete set of articlespresented herein.15We assessed inter-rater reliability by computing Cohen’s Kappa statistic.16Because of theapparent heterogeneity of studies andinconsistency of reported results, weopted not to conduct a meta-analysis.RESULTSOverview.We identified 11 controlledstudies of medical inpatients for thecurrent review, but only eight studiesrandomized patients to VR conditions, orrandomized the order of delivery of VRor standard interventions usingcrossover designs. We observed thatstudies were heterogeneous with regardto targeted disease state, VR equipmentand intervention materials, andoutcomes assessed. Thus, wecategorized results within eachapplication of VR to medical inpatients. Study quality.Studies varied in termsof quality (average quality score=0.87;standard deviation [SD]=0.06;range=0.78–0.96).13The raters were instrong agreement on most study qualitydomains assessed (Cohen’s κ=0.84). Nostudies defined the magnitude of theoutcome to be evaluated (e.g., a 20%drop in pain GRS scores) or explicitlydiscussed cost-effectiveness, althoughfour studies did consider VR devicecost.15,17–19Five of the 11 studies usedsmall samples (i.e., n<30), as expectedin a novel technology efficacy trial.19–23Notably, the lowest rated study(Patterson et al21) and the highest ratedstudy (Schmitt et al15) were authored bymembers of the same study team.15,21Lower quality studies utilized smallersamples, did not randomize participants,and did not consider all factorsassociated with treatment (e.g., cost,adherence, side effects). Higher quality studies conformed to the expectedstructure of an RCT, justified and utilized larger samples, and considered patient side effects. We observed no temporal patterns in study quality, and found no associations between targeted disease state and quality score.Pain distraction.As shown in Table1, VR is used for pain management in inpatient populations more commonly than for other applications. Most researchers utilized the SnowWorld VRsystem (University of Washington HITLab and Harborview Burn Center,Seattle Washington)—the first VR software created for pain control during burn wound redressing—consisting ofan HMD through which patients view and interact with snow-themed characters and throw virtual snow ballsat approaching snowmen via a computer mouse or keyboard.20,24In a first-of-its-kind study of burn victims using SnowWorld, Hoffman et al20observed a41-percent reduction in pain in the VR condition versus a control group, as well a strong negative correlation between self-reported “immersion” in the VR environment and pain ratings. Schmitt etal15observed significant reductions in cognitive pain (time spent thinking about pain, reduced 44%), affective pain(emotional unpleasantness, reduced32%), and sensory pain (reduced 27%),as well as highly positive feelings toward the VR intervention (which many labelledas “fun”). Carrougher et al17alsoobserved reductions in pain unpleasantness (31%), time spent thinking about pain (31%), and worstpain experienced (27%) in VRconditions, but did not observestatistically significant improvements inrange of motion (ROM) physical therapy,which consists of assisted exercisesdesigned to help patients gainmovement in affected body segments(e.g. hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, knee,or ankle). A study by Patterson et al21assessedthe analgesic efficacy of virtual realityhypnosis (VRH), a new procedure inwhich the hypnotist verbally expressessuggestions that focus the patient’sattention away from pain. Based onscores obtained both immediately afterthe interventions and eight hours later,VRH patients reported lessunpleasantness and less pain intensitythan both control groups (VR withouthypnosis, or standard analgesictreatment alone). Two studies of burn patients utilizinglow-cost, easily accessible andaffordable VR HMD systems (Z8003DVisor, eMagin, New York, New York)and off-the-shelf software computergames did not report significantdifferences in self-reported painmeasures or anxiety (see Table 2 fordetailed descriptions of scales used).Morris et al19compared adult burnpatient exposure to VR (video gamesplus analgesics) to a control condition(analgesics alone) and found amarginally significant difference in painreduction between conditions (p=0.06),but no significant decreases in self-reported anxiety. In the Kipping et alstudy,18patients did not report decreasesin pain during burn wound redressing,but nursing staff observed significantreductions.One study utilized wall projectionsand motion detection instead of HMDsto examine the effectiveness oftherapeutic play for reducing depressivesymptoms in pediatric oncologypatients.25After a week of treatment,children in the experimental groupreported significantly fewer depressivesymptoms than those in the controlgroup, but they did not report significantdifferences in state anxiety. Eating disorders (EDs) and obesity.Two recent studies investigating theefficacy of VR treatment in populationswith EDs are presented in Table 1. Cesaet al26assessed the brief and long-termefficacy of VR plus cognitive-behavioraltherapy in a group of 90 female patientswith obesity at an inpatient rehabilitationclinic. In the VR treatment arm,participants wore HMDs and navigatedthrough 14 different virtualenvironments. Patients were exposed totempting situations (e.g., buying unhealthy food at the supermarket) to improve self-control and motivation, aswell as situations that challenged negative body image (e.g., swimming pool). Although improvements in body satisfaction were reported in all study conditions, only patients in the VR condition reported improved body image perceptions at five-week follow-up. After one year, VR patients were significantly better (44.4%) at improving or maintaining weight loss than patients in control conditions (10.4%). Manzoni et al27demonstrated that both VR and imagination-based relaxation training conditions helpedreduce emotional eating, anxiety,depressive symptoms, and self-efficacy(see Table 2 for scales used). However, ata three-month follow-up, the VR condition—wherein patients wandered inan idyllic mountain landscape—demonstrated greater efficacy in reducing emotional eating than control conditions.Cognitive and motor rehabilitation.In a study by Larson et al,23patients of all ages with traumatic brain injuries (TBI)completed 12 four-minute-long cancellation exercises using a system called Virtual Reality and Robotic Optical Operations Machine (VRROOM[developed by Patton et al38]; See Table2) over a period of two days.23Theauthors observed improvements in memory and attention across trials as measured by target acquisition times.Distractions involving both visual and haptic stimuli were especially effective.Also, in a study by Yin et al,22strokepatients utilized the Sixense VR system(Sixense, Los Gatos, California), are habilitation gaming software consisting of an avatar on a screen that is synchronized with the patient’smovements.22In a virtual environment,users are instructed to pick fruit from ashelf and release it into a basket as manytimes as possible within a two-minutetime frame. The authors observedimproved sensorimotor function for bothVR and non-VR (conventional physicaltherapy) conditions, as measured by theFugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA; see Table2), though no significant differenceswere found between conditions. Patient satisfaction and side effects.Patient satisfaction and side effects aredisplayed in the “SecondaryObservations” column in Table 1.Participants often rated VR sessions asmore fun, more immersive, more useful,and more enjoyable than non-VR conditions.15,20,22Despite previous findings that HMDs or peripheral devices often restrict movement, no such results were found in the present review.28A majority of studies did not report VR side effects, such as motion sicknessor fatigue, as factors negatively influencing patient satisfaction or the efficacy of VR treatments. When asked,patients in the study by Kipping et al17did not report experiencing nausea, and97 percent of patients in the sutdy by Carrougher et al18reported no to mild nausea after using HMDs. Yin et al22found no significant side effects, and deemed VR technology feasible and safefor participants. However, in the Larsonet al23study of 18 patients with TBI,three participants dropped out due to fatigue and eye pain caused by the VRROOM system (Table 2).DISCUSSION In contrast to previous reviews of case reports and observational evidence,the present review focused on controlled studies that describe applications of VR technology in the treatment and rehabilitation of medical inpatients.29,30Data from 11 eligible studies provide insight into three current medical applications of VR technology: pain distraction, eating disorders, and cognitive/motor rehabilitation.Pain distraction.VR is particularly useful as a pain distraction that supplements or replaces traditional pharmacotherapies. According to Wiederhold,7pain perception is dependent on a patient’s capacity to attend to a certain stimulus. Thus, pain management may be achieved byblocking sensory information via opioidanalgesics or by creating a distractionfrom pain by immersing a patient in avirtual environment.11,31Previous studieshave demonstrated that opioidanalgesics may lead to undesirableconsequences, such as nausea,increased length of hospitalizations, andinadequate pain alleviation.32VR presentsa useful alternative with minimal sideeffects, although nausea may bereported from either treatment.Five of seven studies demonstratedthat VR is an efficacious non-pharmacologic adjunct to standard opioid analgesic treatments to reduce pain, distress, and anxiety in adult and pediatric patients undergoing unpleasant medical procedures. Highlighting the psychological components of pain, VR distraction treatments reduce self-reported unpleasantness, time spent thinking about pain, and levels of worst pain experienced.15,17These patient-reported observations are corroborated by neuroimaging studies that have highlighted five brain regions showing reduced activity during VRinterventions—thalamus, insula, primaryand secondary somatosensory cortices,and the anterior cingulate cortex.17Overall, both physiological andpsychological measures suggest that VRis a helpful clinical tool in paindistraction. EDs and obesity.VR is used in eatingdisorders to improve patient body imageexperiences, increase self-efficacy, andpractice healthy decision-making.7Participants may navigate a virtualsupermarket to make healthy foodchoices or they may be encouraged toadopt less harmful perceptions of bodyimage through repeated exposure toimages of diverse body types.1Inconjunction with other psychologicaltherapies (e.g., graded exposure orcognitive-behavioral therapy), patientsdevelop skills that carry over into thereal world. VR therapies are useful not only forreplicating a desired environment, butalso for altering reality (e.g., an avatarthat no longer resembles the patient).9This strategy is consistent with Bem’s(1972) self-perception theory,39which postulates that “individuals developattitudes by observing their own behaviorand concluding what attitudes must havecaused them.” Observing an avatar’sappearance as different from the actualself may shape and change the patients’own attitudes—a phenomenon known asthe Proteus effect.40This strategy hasbeen especially successful in thetreatment of body dysmorphic disorder,binge eating, and anorexia.7As reviewedherein, use of virtual environments, pluslow-calorie diets and exercise, led tosignificant improvements in body imageconcerns, weight loss, and bodysatisfaction while also reducing anxietyand emotional eating.26Additionallongitudinal studies must be conducted inorder to assess the long-term efficacy ofVR interventions in preventing weightgain. Cognitive and motor rehabilitation.VR also presents a novel rehabilitationapproach for patients with strokes,Parkinson’s disease, and brain injuries.7VR training allows for high ecologicalvalidity in a safe and controlledenvironment, provides immediate visualand tactile feedback about the individual’sspecific performance, and may boostmotivation.33–35Experimenter-manipulatedenvironments allow for individualizedtraining to enhance specific skills andneuroplasticity through repeated practice,as well as a means of helping patientsovercome underutilization of limbs.28Theintervention studies reviewed hereinconsisted of repeated safe practice ofparticular skills with the help ofsuperimposed virtual limbs that trainindividuals in tasks specific to theirmedical condition. Inconsistent resultssuggest that further testing of VR in motorand cognitive rehabilitation is required.22,23Limitations.We only included 11controlled trials in medical inpatientpopulations, and did not consider othersuccessful case studies or efficaciousoutpatient interventions. Because of theheterogeneity of this small number ofstudies, we could not conduct a formalmeta-analysis. Additional studies will needto be conducted to assess the efficacy ofVR fully.Future research. Whereas earlystudies of VR utilized costly platformsprecluding widespread use, more recentversions are available at price points thatgreatly improve affordability andaccessibility.36In the present review, twostudies using low-cost off-the-shelfHMD visors did not report significantpain reductions.18,19Future researchshould further examine whether thequality of HMD technology is associatedwith improved efficacy. Future studies of VR in medicalinpatients should utilize larger samplesassessed over time to investigate long-term effects.37Although most VR studiesare found within hospital settings, someclinicians predict VR will be used ashome-based rehabilitation in the future.According to Sandlund, McDonough andHäger-Ross, interactive computer playand VR are especially helpful forphysicallydisabled children who areoften treated at home.29In the hospital setting, VR could beused by patients suffering from chronicpain syndromes (e.g., chronicpancreatitis, back pain, and/or refractorymigraines) or used to reduce pain andanxiety in the emergency department(e.g., for reduction of dislocated joints,suturing of lacerations, cardioversion forarrhythmias, or casting of fractures). VRcould also be used as a distraction forpatients undergoing magnetic resonanceimaging or computed tomographyscanning, during interventionalprocedures or hemodialysis, or as partof chemotherapy infusion protocols.CONCLUSIONOverall, a majority of studies from thepast decade found VR to be efficacious,easy to use, safe, and contributing tohigh patient satisfaction. Studies variedin terms of quality, but we observed norelationship between study quality andkey findings. In most cases, patientsconsidered the VR experience to be fun,immersive, and enjoyable, and fewpatients were lost to attrition due to sideeffects.The use of VR in medical fields isrelatively novel but also promising.37It ishighly interactive, flexible, tailored to theindividual, and applicable to peoplevarying in age, sex, and medicaldisorders. As technology improves andcosts are reduced, VR will undoubtedlyshape the future of healthcare.REFERENCES1.Ferrer-Garcia M, Gutiérrez-MaldonadoJ, Riva G.

In clinical settings and experimental studies, participantsimmersed in VR experience reduced levels of pain, general distress/unpleasantness and report adesire to use VR again during painful medical procedures. Investigators hypothesize that VR actsas a nonpharmacologic form of analgesia by exerting an array of emotional affective, emotion-based cognitive and attentional processes on the body’s intricate pain modulation system. Whilethe exact neurobiological mechanisms behind VR’s action remain unclear, investigations arecurrently underway to examine the complex interplay of cortical activity associated withimmersive VR. Recently, new applications, including VR, have been developed to augmentevidenced-based interventions, such as hypnosis and biofeedback, for the treatment of chronicpain. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature, exploring clinical andexperimental applications of VR for acute and chronic pain management, focusing specifically oncurrent trends and recent developments. In addition, we propose mechanistic theories highlightingVR distraction and neurobiological explanations, and conclude with new directions in VRresearch, implications and clinical significance.Virtual reality (VR) is a state-of-the-art technologically advanced system that allows users tobe transported into a ‘virtual world.’ Users are engaged in a fully immersive VR experiencethrough a combination of technologies, including a head-mounted display (HMD),headphones with sound/music and noise reduction, a rumble pad, joystick or another devicefor manipulation/navigation of the virtual environment (VE). VR also includes head-tracking systems, which are often built into the HMD. These systems follow the user’s headmovements, giving them the illusion of being completely surrounded by a virtual world.Multimodal (visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory) stimuli contribute to a sense of actualpresence/immersion in the virtual world, thus making the VR experience distinct frompassively watching television or movies, or playing a 2D handheld videogame or gameconsole. A variety of VR systems have been developed and investigated from low- to high-tech systems, including nonimmersive 2D VR systems administered without helmets to fully immersive VR systems with multimodal stimuli, resulting in mixed outcome efficacy.Figures 1 & 2 show applications of the VR technology.Originally, VR technology was solely recognized for its entertainment value; however, inthe past 10 years, its application has been expanded to a variety of clinical areas, includingpain management, physical rehabilitation and the treatment of psychiatric disorders (e.g.,phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder) [1–4]. It has been mostfrequently studied in medical settings as a means to attenuate pain perception, anxiety andgeneral distress during painful medical procedures, such as wound care, chemotherapy,dental procedures and routine medical procedures [5–9].To date, few theories have been proposed regarding the pain-attenuating effects of VRbeyond simple distraction. In an attempt to understand the underlying mechanistic origin forVR analgesia, investigators have considered the neurobiological interplay of brain corticesand neurochemistry, as well as emotional, cognitive and attentional processes. While VR hasbeen demonstrated in a variety of settings to effectively decrease pain and distress associatedwith painful procedures, researchers have only recently begun to deconstruct patient anddisease characteristics, specific aspects of VR technology, and to identify neurobiologicalmechanisms underlying VR.Melzack and Wall proposed the Gate Control Theory, which suggests that factors such asthe level of attention paid to the pain, the emotion associated with the pain and pastexperience of the pain all play a role in how the pain will be interpreted [10]. McCaul andMalott expanded this theory to state that human beings have a limited capacity of attentionand an individual must attend to a painful stimulus in order for it to be perceived as painful[11]. Therefore, if the individual is attending to another stimuli away from the noxiousstimuli, they will perceive the painful stimulus as less intense. Wickens proposed theMultiple Resources Theory, which states that resources in different sensory systems functionindependently [12]. This supports the nature of VR technology, which is based onintegrating multimodal (visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory) sensory distractions.Recently, Gold et al. hypothesized that VR analgesia originates from intercorticalmodulation among signaling pathways of the pain matrix through attention, emotion,memory and other senses (e.g., touch, auditory and visual), thereby producing analgesia[13]. An overall decrease of activities in the pain matrix may be accompanied by increasesof activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal regions of the brain.While there is substantial research supporting the use of VR for the attenuation of acute painduring medical procedures, the exploration of VR use for chronic pain management is still inits inception. Investigations must be conducted to further understand VR’s role in acute andchronic pain management. Current studies are underway to understand the underlyingmechanisms behind VR’s analgesic effects and to deconstruct the patient (age, gender andpain history), disease and technology (HMD, head tracking and VE) characteristics.Ultimately, understanding the influences and interactions of these independent variables willlead to optimal patient/VR matching, thus, personalizing the interventions to maximize VR’spain-attenuating effects. Hopefully, lessons learned from these early VR investigations willhave applications in chronic pain management and other pain rehabilitative conditions.Ultimately, the aim of current VR investigations is to develop flexible environmentstargeting specific acute and chronic pain conditions, and to promote long-term rehabilitativepain management. VR for acute pain managementBurn careThe use of VR for pain and anxiety attenuation during burn care procedures andrehabilitation of burn survivors is one of the most widely researched uses of VR technology.Clearly, burn wound care causes a tremendous amount of pain, anxiety and discomfort topatients. In 2000, Hoffman et al. reported a case study examining the efficacy of VRcompared with a standard video game for two adolescents (16 and 17 years old) undergoingburn wound care [14]. VR was found to decrease pain levels, anxiety and time spentthinking about pain. Das et al. conducted a randomized control trial, comparing standard ofcare (analgesia) with analgesia plus VR for children (5–18 years old) during burn woundcare [15]. Analgesia coupled with VR was more effective in reducing pain and distress thananalgesia alone. More recently, a water-friendly VR system was investigated during wounddebridement for 11 patients (9–40 years), demonstrating that VR lowered pain ratings andincreased fun ratings for those who reported feeling engrossed in the VR game [16].Virtual reality technology has also been studied with burn patients undergoing physicaltherapy. Hoffman et al. examined the use of pharmacologic analgesia alone versus VR inaddition to analgesia during physical therapy [17]. Patients in the VR group reported lowerratings of pain and an increased range of motion. In another study, Hoffman et al. comparedthe use of VR to no distraction during physical therapy [18]. After the VR condition,patients reported decreased pain and a greater range of motion. Sharar et al. reported resultsacross three studies and concluded that VR in addition to standard analgesia reduced painintensity, unpleasantness and time spent thinking about pain [19]. Carrougher et al. foundsimilar results among burn patients undergoing physical therapy/rehabilitation, withnonsignificant clinical improvements in range of motion [20].Patterson and colleagues were the first to use VR technology to augment hypnosis (virtualreality hypnosis [VRH]) [21]. This was a novel and cutting-edge approach to the integrationof VR with a pre-existing evidence-based treatment for reducing pain and anxiety.Procedurally, VRH is administered by providing the patient with an audio recording ofhypnotic induction, suggestions for pain relief and then drifting the participant into thevirtual world [22]. Patterson et al. studied VR as a means of delivering hypnosis to patientswith burns during wound care in a clinical case series of 13 patients [21]. These patientsreported lower levels of pain and anxiety. For this study, Patterson used a VR distractionsequence, SnowWorld©, developed by Hoffman, which allows users to glide through a 3Dicy canyon while throwing snowballs at virtual snowmen, igloos, robots and penguins.Similarly, Konstantatos et al. examined the efficacy of VR relaxation in addition tomorphine for pain reduction during burn wound dressing changes. Instead of using adistraction type program, such as SnowWorld, the researchers developed a VR relaxationsequence prepared by psychologists and based on hypnotherapy theory [23]. This providedcalming visual scenery, which instructed the participant to concentrate on a moving spiral.Contrary to previous results, this study found an increase in pain intensity for participantsreceiving VR with morphine during wound care. Mixed findings may be related to the VE,the degree of immersion and varying methodologies. While VR distraction is effective forreducing pain during burn wound care, VR relaxation may not deliver the same result.In general, VR has been reported to be an effective modality to decrease pain during burncare. A recent systematic review of nine studies by Morris et al. found that VR coupled withstandard analgesia was effective in reducing pain during burn care in eight of the ninestudies [5]. Varying methodologies, patient characteristics and VR technology, maycontinue to contribute to mixed findings. Nonetheless, continued research in burn care is warranted with VR and VR enhanced interventions for managing the associated pain andanxiety.Cancer painVirtual reality technology has also been studied as a way to decrease pain, unpleasantnessand anxiety associated with common painful cancer procedures and treatments, such aschemotherapy, lumbar puncture and port access. A study by Schneider and Workmanexamined 11 children (aged 10–17 years) receiving chemotherapy with and without VR[24]. A total of 82% of the children stated that treatment with VR was better than previoustreatments and that they would like to use VR during future treatments. Sander Wint et al.investigated VR use during lumbar puncture with a sample of 30 adolescents (aged 10–19years) [25]. Although pain scores were lower in the VR condition, differences were notstatistically significant. A study by Gershon et al., studying children and adolescentsrequiring port access, compared VR distraction, non-VR distraction (computer) and standardof care [26]. Findings indicated that VR distraction was significantly better than standard ofcare in terms of reducing physiological arousal (i.e., pulse rate) and pain ratings. VR hasalso been demonstrated to decrease symptom distress and perceived time spent receivingchemotherapy, termed the time–elapse compression effect [6,27].Routine medical proceduresMany routine medical procedures, such as a blood draw, intravenous placement andimmunization can be painful and anxiety provoking. Gold et al. investigated the use of VRdistraction during outpatient blood draw in children [28]. The sample consisted of 100children (8–12 years old) stratified for age and gender into four conditions: no distraction,cartoon distraction, VR via computer or VR via HMD. The children in all conditions placedtheir arm through a pass wall for the blood draw in order to control for visual occlusion.Children in the VR HMD group reported a lower frequency of moderate-to-severe painintensity levels compared with the other three groups (χ2 [15, N = 100] = 25.54, p < 0.05).No significant differences were found in average pain intensity and state anxiety betweenthe four conditions. Gold et al. examined the use of VR with 20 children (8–12 years of age)requiring intravenous placement of contrast for an MRI CT scan [9]. Children wererandomly assigned to one of two conditions: standard of care (topical anesthetic) or VRpresented via HMD plus standard of care. While children in the control condition had afourfold increase in pain (p < 0.01), children in the VR condition reported no significantchanges in pain intensity between pre- and postintravenous placement. Furthermore,children, caregivers and nurses were more satisfied with the use of VR for pain managementduring the procedure.Furman et al. compared VR with watching movies as alternative forms of analgesia in 38patients during scaling and root planning, a painful dental procedure [7]. Pain scores weresignificantly lower in the VR group compared with the movie group and controls. Furman etal. modeled the study closely on a case study by Hoffman et al. [18], which examined twopatients who received scaling and root planning, and both reported lower pain ratings duringthe VR condition than during the movie and control conditions.VR for chronic pain managementWhile there is growing evidence supporting VR’s effectiveness in managing acuteprocedural pain, little is known about the use of VR for treating patients with chronic painand/or for long-term pain rehabilitation. To date, only a few studies have investigated VRfor chronic pain management and the data are preliminary. Sato et al. investigated the use of VR for treating complex regional pain syndrome in adults[29]. In this pilot study, a VR mirror visual feedback system was created and applied to thetreatment of complex regional pain syndrome in five adult patients (46–74 years old). Thiswas a nonimmersive form of VR, as participants were not engaged in VR through an HMD.However, the game was interactive as the VR mirror visual tracking device followed theparticipants’ hands as they completed target-oriented motor exercises such as reaching out,grasping, transferring and placing. In the study, patients participated in five to eightoutpatient sessions, resulting in four of the five patients demonstrating at least 50%reduction in their pain intensity scores. This study demonstrates how VR could be appliedfor the treatment of chronic pain. Further investigations with larger samples and refinedmethodologies must be conducted to replicate these results. In addition, future studiesshould look at the effectiveness of immersive VR programs for the treatment of complexregional pain syndrome and other chronic pain conditions.Sarig-Bahat et al. investigated VR’s ability to treat chronic neck pain in 67 patients (22–65years) with and without symptoms [30]. The investigators used a VR environment, whichencouraged patients to increase their range of motion by ‘spraying’ flies with a virtual spraycanister. In theory, the more they engaged in the activity, the greater their range of motionwould become. The investigators found that a single session of VR resulted in increasedcervical range of motion and decreased neck pain.Hoffman et al. explored whether immersive VR could help reduce pain during repeatedphysical therapy sessions for burn victims [18]. During three sessions, seven patients (9–32years of age) came to perform range-of-motion exercises under an occupational therapists’direction. Participants spent an equal amount of time during the session with VR distractionand without. The investigators found that pain ratings were significantly lower when patientswere immersed in VR and the magnitude of pain reduction did not decrease over multiplesessions. These findings are promising as they indicate a potential for VR to be applied tolong-term physical therapy.As described in acute pain management, VR has recently been studied to augment the effectof hypnosis for the treatment of chronic pain. In a case study of a 36-year old female with a5-year history of retractable chronic neuropathic pain, investigators found that following a 6-month trial of VRH, the patient’s pain ratings decreased 36% for 3.86 h and unpleasantnessdecreased 33% for 12.21 h on average across 33 sessions [22]. In addition, when the first tensessions of VRH were compared with the first ten sessions of previously completedhypnosis (non-VR) treatment, investigators found that VRH led to a reported average of 8.5h of pain reduction and 4.3 h of being pain free, compared with an average of 1 h of painreduction and 0 h of being pain free after hypnosis (non-VR). In conclusion, VRH wasfound to be more effective than hypnosis alone, by reducing pain and prolonging thetreatment effects. Although the usage of VR for chronic pain management is still in itsinfancy, pilot findings are promising.Experimental pain & VR in healthy populationsA critical line of research is the examination of experimental pain and VR in healthyparticipants. This paradigm has many advantages, as investigators are attempting to isolateand/or deconstruct critical parameters involved in the clinical efficacy of VR. These studiesallow investigators to look at the effects of VR while controlling confounding factors suchas clinical pathology, exposure to pain or adjunctive medications, hospital environment, andvarious other patient and disease characteristics. Therefore, this type of research enablesinvestigators to control and manipulate the effects of the unique characteristics thatcontribute to VR distraction or modulation Experimental pain has been delivered through a variety of mechanical and thermalmodalities, including a modified tourniquet [31], an ischemic tourniquet [32], a bloodpressure cuff [33], cold pressor [34–36] and a noxious warm or cold thermal painstimulation (Figure 3) [37]. In general, VR has been demonstrated to be effective inincreasing pain tolerance and pain threshold, and decreasing pain intensity, affective distressand pain unpleasantness [31–37].There is scientific concern that individuals may habituate to VR and, therefore, lose itsbenefits over repeated exposures. Rutter et al. conducted an 8-week trial of once-weekly VRdistraction during a cold pressor pain paradigm on 28 adults (18–23 years old) [35]. Resultsindicated that VR distraction led to significant increases in pain threshold and paintolerance, and significant decreases in pain intensity, time spent thinking about pain andself-reported anxiety. Unique findings specific to this study demonstrated that the effects ofVR remained stable across the eight sessions, indicating that repeated exposure did not alterVR’s effectiveness. These findings are similar to a clinical trial of VR versus traditionalphysical therapy for patients following burn injuries. Hoffman et al. demonstrated that VRreduced pain across multiple physical therapy sessions and treatment effects persistedwithout habituation for patients with burns [18]. Additional studies should investigatewhether treatment effects continue across treatment sessions for participants with other painconditions.Another line of VR investigation has specifically focused on the technology anddifferentiating the effects of HMD versus no HMD, and high versus low HMD technology.Dahlquist et al. found that the use of an HMD resulted in an increase in pain threshold andpain tolerance for children over the age of 10 years, but had no significant differences forchildren under 10 years of age [34,36]. Hoffman et al. compared a low- versus high-tech VRHMD for pain attenuation during an experimental thermal pain paradigm and found that thehigh-tech VR helmet group reported greater reductions in ‘worst’ pain (34%), ‘painunpleasantness’ (46%) and ‘time spent thinking about pain’ (29%), as well as greater funduring the pain stimulus (32%) than the low-tech VR group [38]. Only 29% of participantsin the low-tech helmet group, compared with 65% of participants in the high-tech VRhelmet group, showed a clinically significant reduction in pain intensity during VR.Together, these results reflect important developmental and technological considerationswhen evaluating the impact and efficacy of VR. The current results suggest that the use of aHMD with older children resulted in an increase in pain threshold and pain tolerance, whilethe use of a high-tech VR HMD was more effective at reducing pain than a low-tech VRHMD.Patterson et al. combined posthypnotic suggestion with VR distraction versus VR alone in103 undergraduate psychology student volunteers (18–40 years old) [21]. After receiving athermal pain stimulus with no distracter at baseline, each participant received hypnosis or nohypnosis, followed by virtual reality distraction (VRD) or no VRD during another painstimulus. Patterson et al. found that audio hypnosis combined with VRD reduced subjective‘worst pain’ and ‘pain unpleasantness’ by 22 and 25%, respectively, more than VRD alone[21]. Combination therapies, which include VR as a method for delivering hypnosis training,may be promising new therapies for managing pain.VR & neurobiologyFunctional imaging studies of the human brain’s response to painful stimuli have shownincreases of activities in the anterior cingulate gyrus, the insula, the thalamus, andsometimes in other regions such as the primary somatosensory cortex and the periaqueductalgray matter [39–47]. These brain regions may be considered to host a network of circuitry involved in the bottom-up, top-down and intercortical processing of painful stimuli, or evensomewhere, somehow the origin of the experience of pain itself. However, these regionsalso respond more or less to a range of aversive to nonaversive stimuli, and a wide range oftask-driven attention, distraction or affective conditions [40,42,45]. The responses of somesubsets of these regions have been related to sensation/pain intensity and painunpleasantness by imaging with well-controlled psychophysical measures [48–53].However, difficulties in separating brain regions that process sensory information fromthose that mediate affective responses is presently an area of active debate. To date,functional imaging or other methods of investigation have not produced an objective, directbrain correlate of the pain experience, nor is there a clear picture of how the brain’s sensoryand affective mechanisms act together on the dimension of pain in response to potentiallyaversive stimuli.Virtual reality has been found to attenuate pain, and this effect has been called ‘VRanalgesia’ [35,54–56]. The subjective ratings of pain reduction by VR has been corroboratedwith functional MRI (fMRI) data showing reduced brain activity increases in regionscommonly strongly activated by experimental thermal pain stimulation (Figure 4).Hoffman’s study, however, mainly focuses on whether VR game playing, as a whole,significantly reduces the increase of brain activities in the classic pain areas associated withnoxious thermal stimuli. Another published study compared VR with the effects of opioids(hydromorphone injection) on brain activities related to thermal pain stimulation, and foundthat opioids and VR significantly reduced pain-related brain activity in the insula andthalamus, but not other regions of the pain circuitry [54]. On the other hand, other cognitivetasks have been demonstrated to attenuate brain activity in the classic pain circuitry duringexperimental pain stimulation. Bantick et al. proposed a theory of pain attenuation viadistraction (exemplified by an adapted Stroop task) to decrease pain perception as measuredby fMRI and subjective pain ratings in eight right-handed volunteers (mean age 30 ± 9years) [57]. The adaptive counting Stroop task required the subject to count the number ofwords with incongruent meanings on the display screen. Subjective reports of pain intensitywere lower during the Stroop distraction condition. During the distraction task, there was anoverall decrease in BOLD signal in the insula, thalamus, hippocampus and midcingulateregion of the anterior cingulated cortex, which are known brain regions associated with painperception. Inversely, an increase in BOLD signal was observed in the perigenual region ofthe anterior cingulated cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, demonstrating the plausibility ofinter-cortical modulation or top-down inhibition of pain signaling. Valet et al. hypothesizedthat the cingulo–frontal cortex may exert top-down influences on the periaqueductal graymatter and posterior thalamus to modulate pain during distraction [58]. Performing thecounting Stroop task requires sustained attention plus other high-level cognitive functions.Whether the counting Stroop task’s analgesic effect is explained solely by attention ‘gating’or via other mechanisms cannot be determined by Bantick’s or Valet’s data. The increasedactivity in the cingulo–frontal cortex may be caused by the increased cognitive demand ofthe task, not simply by the mechanism of attention distraction alone [59]. In other words,attention does not necessitate task loading, but task loading does require attention.Additional studies are required to shed light on these issues to advance our understanding ofthe underlying cortical processes responsible for pain attenuation.While known distracting cognitive tasks have demonstrated top-down modulation of painsignaling via frontal cortical processes, VR remains somewhat enigmatic with regard to itsunderlying neurobiological mechanisms. To date, in addition to the distraction of attention,studies have associated cognitive analgesic effects to cognitive task loading [59], mood [60],expectancy [61] and perceived controllability [62]. A VR environment is capable ofmanipulating an even more complex set of cognitive and emotional conditions than thepresentation of most classic cognitive tasks. Therefore, VR’s analgesic effect may originate from the interplay of these classic mechanisms or from something beyond. For example, aVR environment is well known for eliciting a ‘transported’ presence, over and beyond anycognitive tasks the subject is performing at the same time. Elaborate experimental designscapable of isolating the contribution of transported presence are required to illuminate theneural mechanisms underlying VR analgesia.Current NIH studiesThe number of NIH-funded studies investigating the use of VR for pain management hasdoubled in the past year [101]. Cohen (Georgia State University, USA) is looking at theeffectiveness of coaching children in deep-breathing relaxation (biofeedback) through a VRsystem during fracture manipulation and repair [101]. Patterson (University of Washington,USA) is examining the efficacy of VR combined with hypnosis for patients who haveexperienced severe physical trauma and pediatric patients undergoing physical therapypostburn. In addition, Patterson will conduct an experimental study using analog electricpain to further explore the mechanisms underlying VR’s analgesic effects [101].Sharar (University of Washington) will study the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlyingVR as compared with other pharmacologic pain management methods. This study will beconducted in a healthy adult population with thermally and/or electrically induced pain. Painwill be rated through subjective measures and fMRI [101]. Similarly, Gold (University ofSouthern California, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, USA) will employ fMRI to explorethe neurobiological mechanisms involved in VR pain attenuation in healthy adolescents(aged 14–17 years). An experimental fMRI-compatible thermal pain paradigm will be usedto evaluate the hypothesis that VR will reduce brain activity in brain regions associated withpain perception (e.g., thalamus, somatosensory and motor cortices, insular cortices,cingulated cortices and basal ganglia) [101]. In addition, the reduction of brain activityobserved in regions associated with pain perception during VR will concurrently beassociated with increased activity in distal regions of the brain (e.g., prefrontal cortex)commonly associated with attention, emotion, cognition and response inhibition. Sharar andGold’s studies will provide important insight into VR’s underlying mechanistic effects onneural activity in participants subjected to experimental pain [101].Wichman Askay (University of Washington) will investigate the use of VRH as treatmentfor chronic burn pain. Participants must have been burned in the past 2 years, stillexperience pain and no longer use medication. This pilot study may provide valuableknowledge for the use of VR in the treatment of chronic pain [101].ConclusionVirtual reality has consistently been demonstrated to decrease pain, anxiety, unpleasantness,time spent thinking about pain and perceived time spent in a medical procedure. In addition,healthcare providers have routinely commented that VR increases procedural cooperation,while decreasing anxiety and distress. Nurses have commented that it helps children be lessnervous and more calm, leading to less challenging and stressful medical procedures. VR incombination with standard of care often facilitates a smoother procedure (i.e., fewer needlepricks/attempts). To date, VR for acute painful medical procedures has shown the bestpromise as a primary or complementary pain management practice. However, other studieshave reported negative effects, mixed findings or limitations owing to age and/ortechnology.To date, few studies have researched VR as a complementary intervention for managingchronic pain or facilitating pain rehabilitation. Preliminary studies have demonstrated thatVR maintains its efficacy over repeated sessions, speeds up pain rehabilitation, increases the range of motion and extends the duration of treatment effects (i.e., longer perceptions ofreduced pain and unpleasantness). As the field advances, VR may decrease the number ofneeded treatment sessions, and may reduce or eliminate the need for narcotics during painfulprocedures. VR is showing initial promise for managing chronic pain and facilitating long-term pain rehabilitation; however, numerous scientific questions remain.Although chronic pain affects an estimated 70 million Americans, it is a tragicallyoverlooked public health problem [102]. The documented burden of chronic pain is greaterthan that of diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. A 1998 NIH report concluded thatthe economic toll of chronic pain is alone estimated at US$100 billion a year in the USAwith predicted steady and significant increases in years to come [103]. Future investigationsof VR for chronic pain management are warranted given the scope, severity, and especiallygiven the personal and societal burden of the illness. Future studies should continue todeconstruct critical variables identified in VR analgesia and controlled trials should beconducted using rigorous methodologies with standardized outcomes to evaluate theefficacy of VR for chronic pain management.A new line of VR research has recently emerged augmenting evidence-based therapies, suchas biofeedback and hypnosis with VR technology. To this end, investigators are currentlyresearching VRH and VR biofeedback for children and adults with chronic pain. To date,investigators have found that VR and hypnosis used together are more effective than VR orhypnosis alone. Therefore, coupling VR with these therapies might prove to be valuable forthe management of chronic pain and long-term pain rehabilitation.Finally, investigations are currently underway to determine the neurobiological mechanismsunderlying VR’s ability to decrease pain perception. Current fMRI results indicate thatparticipants who are actively engaged in VR demonstrate inhibition of pain signaling in thecritical regions of the pain matrix; although this finding is not novel to VR alone. Similardecreases in cortical activation in the pain matrix during experimentally induced pain havebeen observed when using adapted Stroop cognitive tasks involving the distraction ofattention, task loading [59], mood [60], expectancy [61] and perceived controllability [62].Therefore, VR researchers are not solely interested in the deactivation of known critical painregions in the pain matrix, but rather the unique interplay of other peripheral cortical areasthat may be influenced by VR. It is hypothesized that frontal lobe/pain inhibitory pathways,critical nerve gating mechanisms and/or other neurochemical processes may be triggeredduring VR, thus leading to decreased pain, increased top-down inhibition and possibly VRanalgesia. Ultimately, understanding the myriad of neurobiological mechanisms underlyingVR analgesia will be critical for creating age and developmentally appropriate clinicalinterventions for acute painful procedures and a variety of chronic pain conditions.Future perspectiveScientists, clinicians and educators are just beginning to scratch the surface when it comes tocurrent applications of VR for pain management. Historically, VR technology has beenexpensive, available to few and mostly sought out by researchers and gaming technicians.The current state of VR as a tool for pain management is still in its early developmentalstages. With technology rapidly evolving, increased interest in complementarynonpharmacological interventions, and the reported burden and disability associated withincreasing rates of chronic pain, VR is quickly gaining attention as a complementary painmanagement strategy. What was once valued solely as high-tech entertainment equipmenthas now captured the interest of neuroscientists, clinical researchers and pain managementclinicians. Virtual reality will have a significant impact in the areas of acute and chronic painmanagement, as well as psychiatric and pain/physical rehabilitation over the next 5–10years. As the costs associated with VR technology decrease and the flexibility/customizability of the gaming environments increase, VR will have numerous applicationsfor patients with an array of acute and chronic medical conditions. Eventually, as part of ahealthcare providers toolkit, VR may be integrated into a variety of medical settings forroutine painful medical procedures, physical therapy, pain rehabilitation, chronic painmanagement and to treat a variety of psychiatric conditions (i.e., anxiety, post-traumaticstress disorder and substance abuse), to name a few. The ability to instantly transport thepatient into a virtual world for the purposes of distraction, exposure to a feared situation, orto augment diaphragmatic breathing, guided imagery and/or self-hypnosis makes VR atremendously powerful tool.Ultimately, an important advancement is the portability of VR for private practice andeventually home use. At that point, VR will no longer be used solely in a medical setting forpainful medical procedures, but will be expanded for the management of chronic pain,physical therapy, long-term rehabilitation and other associated symptoms. In addition, VRmay be used to augment and/or deliver other therapies such as hypnosis and biofeedback.The expanding scope of VR is on the rise and is promising for the field of pain managementand beyond. Given the advances in neuroscience, such as increased knowledge regarding theconnectivity of brain and behavior, pain perception and modulation, and the dynamicinterplay between biological and psychological (e.g., attention, memory and emotion)factors implicated in pain perception, VR will emerge as a viable first-line intervention andcomplementary therapy to pharmacologic agents. We are truly just beginning.BibliographyPapers of special note have been highlighted as:▪ of interest▪▪ of considerable interest1. Gershon J, Anderson P, Graap K, Zimand E, Hodges L, Rothbaum BO.

IVR was not associated with any serious adverse events.\r\nDISCUSSION:\r\n\r\nThis review found moderate evidence for the reduction of pain and functional impairment after IVR in patients with acute pain. Further high-quality studies are required for the conclusive judgment of its effectiveness in acute pain, to establish potential benefits for chronic pain, and for safety.'),

The sense of being\r\nimmersed in another setting is particularly\r\nvaluable in exposure therapy, a treatment\r\ntechnique for phobias. Exposure therapy\r\ninvolves subjecting the patient to anxietyproducing\r\nstimuli while allowing the anxiety\r\nto attenuate. These stimuli have\r\ntraditionally been generated by presenting\r\nthe patient with actual physical situations\r\n(in vivo exposure) or by having the patient\r\nimagine the stimulus.\r\nVR allows a third option of exposure in a virtual\r\nsetting that is safer, less embarrassing, and less costly\r\nthen reproducing the real-world situations and more\r\nrealistic than imagining the danger. An additional\r\nadvantage of computer-controlled stimuli is that the\r\npatient can more easily regulate the level of the\r\ninduced anxiety by modifying the parameters of the\r\nworld to reduce or increase fear to match individual\r\ntolerance. All phobia treatment studies to date have\r\nused a headset to reproduce the feeling of presence in\r\nan anxiety-producing situation.\r\nFear of Heights\r\nThe first phobia studies conducted during late 1993\r\nwere for acrophobia—the fear of heights. This phobia\r\nis characterized by a marked anxiety upon exposure to heights, avoidance of heights, and interference\r\nin normal everyday activities as a result of the\r\nfear. In exposure therapy situations the pattern is for\r\npatients’ anxiety to increase as they are exposed to\r\nmore threatening situations, then for anxiety to\r\ndecrease as they spend more time in each situation.\r\nInitial research was a collaborative effort by computer\r\nscientists and therapists from three Atlanta universities:\r\nGeorgia Tech, Clark Atlanta, and Emory [2].\r\nOut of 478 students initially screened for acrophobia,\r\n20 entered the study; 17 completed it. Subjects were\r\nrandomly assigned to either a treatment group or a\r\nwait-list control group. The treatment group had one\r\npre-treatment VR equipment session and seven\r\nweekly 35- to 45-minute sessions during which they\r\nwere exposed to three virtual height situations—-a\r\nvirtual elevator, a series of virtual bridges, and a series\r\nof virtual balconies. Anxiety, avoidance, distress, and\r\nnegative attitudes towards height decreased significantly\r\nfor the treatment group but not for the waitlist\r\ngroup. By all measures, significant improvement\r\nin the phobia response was found among the subjects\r\nwho completed the VR treatment. Seven of the 10\r\ntreatment completes exposed themselves to height\r\nsituations in real life during the treatment period\r\nalthough they were not specifically instructed\r\nto do so.\r\nIt is interesting to note these results were obtained\r\ndespite primitive computer worlds and poor headset image quality. The tests at times involved teleporting\r\nthe patient from one location to another. Although\r\npatients were aware of the artificial nature of the\r\nscenes, they still felt enough sense of presence to\r\nexhibit the phobic responses while in the headset.\r\nPhysical symptoms\r\nincluded sweaty\r\npalms, loss of balance,\r\nand weakness\r\nin the knees.\r\nPatients indicated\r\nthat a sense of reality\r\nin the virtual\r\nsetting was aided by\r\nhaptic props. For\r\nexample, when riding\r\na glass elevator,\r\na metal bar matching\r\nthe bar location\r\nin the virtual headset\r\nwas provided for\r\nthe subject to hold\r\nin the real world. In\r\nthe spider phobia\r\ndiscussed later, this\r\nsame type of prop\r\nmatches the “feel”\r\nof the virtual to the\r\nreal world.\r\nMax and Sarah\r\nNorth and Joseph\r\nCoble from Clark\r\nAtlanta’s Virtual\r\nTechnology Laboratory,\r\nhave done a\r\nfollow up, in-depth\r\ncase study [6]. A\r\nsubject was asked to\r\nrank a list of acrophobic\r\nsituations\r\naccording to the\r\ndegree of anxiety\r\narousal. The subject\r\nwas placed near a virtual bridge that crossed a river in\r\nthe middle of a simulated town. The study consisted\r\nof one pre-test exposure and eight 15- to 28-minute\r\nsessions. The subject started at the least threatening\r\nsituation and then progressed, under his own control,\r\nto the next level of arousal. An anxiety measurement\r\nwas taken every two to five minutes. At one month\r\npost-treatment, the subject was asked to complete an\r\n11-point rating scale to measure the degree of phobic\r\nresponse change. The patient experienced significant\r\nhabituation of anxiety symptoms and exercised less\r\navoidance of phobic situations after the VR treatment.\r\nLarry Hodges from Georgia Tech’s Graphics,\r\nVisualization and Usability Center and Barbara\r\nR o t h b a u m\r\nfrom Emory led\r\nanother followup\r\ncase study\r\nusing what they\r\nterm VR Exposure\r\n(VRE)\r\ntherapy to treat\r\na 19-year-old\r\nundergraduate\r\nstudent with a\r\nfear of heights\r\nand in particular\r\na fear of\r\nglass elevators.\r\nTwice-weekly\r\nexposure therapy\r\nsessions\r\nwere conducted\r\nfor three weeks\r\non a VR glassenclosed\r\nelevator\r\n(Figure 2).\r\nTime in each\r\nexposure was\r\napproximately\r\n35 minutes.\r\nOutcome was\r\nassessed on\r\nmeasures of\r\nanxiety, avoidance,\r\nattitude,\r\ndistress, and a\r\nbehavioral avoidance\r\ntest. VR\r\ngraded exposure\r\nwas successful in\r\nreducing fear of\r\nheights on all measures.\r\nAt about the same time researchers in Atlanta were\r\nconducting their acrophobia studies, Ralph Lamson,\r\na physician at Kaiser Permanente, was doing similar\r\nwork in California in collaboration with the VR company\r\nDivision Inc. [3]. Acrophobia patients were\r\nrecruited through newspaper ads. Each subject was\r\nexposed to one, 50-minute session where he or she\r\ncompleted a chosen task such as crossing the Golden\r\nGate Bridge or riding in a glass-enclosed elevator.\r\nAccording to Lamson, all 40 of the subjects were able\r\nto complete the task of riding up and down a glass\r\nelevator while looking outside after a single VR\r\ntreatment.\r\nOne result of the numerous fear-of-heights studies\r\nwas to generate an interest in trying this technology\r\nwith a variety of other phobias.\r\nFear of Flying\r\nBoth Georgia Tech and Clark Atlanta followed up\r\nthe acrophobia research with independent fear-offlying\r\nstudies. Georgia Tech conducted a case study\r\nusing a virtual airplane which duplicated a passenger\r\nseated by the window in a standard commercial jet\r\n[7]. The passenger could look out the window and\r\nsee the ground and changing sky scenes (Figure 2).\r\nThe patient was a 42-year-old female with a debilitating\r\nfear and avoidance of flying. As an outpatient\r\nfor seven sessions, she was taught traditional anxiety\r\nmanagement techniques. At that point it was mutually\r\ndecided between the doctor and the patient that\r\nexposure therapy would be beneficial. VR sessions\r\nwere held twice weekly with each session lasting\r\napproximately 35 to 45 minutes. A total of six sessions\r\nwere conducted. During each virtual exposure,\r\nthe subject was allowed to progress at her own pace\r\nalong a natural progression of scenarios—sitting on\r\nthe plane with engines off, sitting on a plane with\r\nengines on, taxiing the runway, smooth takeoff,\r\nsmooth flight, close pass over the airport, landing,\r\nrough takeoff, turbulent flight, and rough landing.\r\nTwo days following the last exposure therapy session\r\nthe subject completed a planned, cross-country\r\nflight with her family. Although the contribution of\r\nthe VR treatment to her improvement is not possible\r\nto determine given the prior inclusion of the anxiety\r\nmanagement techniques, the computer-generated\r\nsimulations were considered significant for several\r\nreasons. First, the patient’s reported anxiety on all\r\nmeasures decreased following exposure to the virtual\r\nplane. Second, she was able to complete a long flight,'),

Researches over the years have successfully demon-\r\nstrated the potential of using a virtual reality system for therapeutic\r\n\r\npurposes in various psychological conditions. Unlike conventional\r\n\r\npsychological therapies, a virtual reality system allows individu-\r\nals to be exposed to the fear stimulating situations in a controlled\r\n\r\nenvironment. It helps individuals to gradually adjust to their fear\r\nenvironment, and build up confidence to manage their upcoming\r\npsychological struggle [Riva 2003].\r\n\r\nOne fear which is wide spread in any community is anxiety re-\r\nlated to job interviews. This is particularly true in student popu-\r\nlations who are close to finishing their degrees and are faced with\r\n\r\n∗\r\ne-mail: J.H.Kwon@warwick.ac.uk\r\n†\r\ne-mail:A.G.Chalmers@warwick.ac.uk\r\n‡\r\ne-mail:S.Czanner@warwick.ac.uk\r\n§\r\ne-mail:G.Czanner@warwick.ac.uk\r\n¶\r\ne-mail:John.Powell@warwick.ac.uk\r\n\r\nthe prospect of their first ever job interview which could well de-\r\ntermine their future careers. Career services at Universities are in-\r\nundated with requests for ”mock interviews” to help students gain\r\n\r\nsome interview experience. A virtual job interview environment\r\n\r\nwould enable students to gain valuable experience at a time conve-\r\nnient to them, while at the same time relieving the burden on the\r\n\r\ncareer services.\r\nThis paper investigates what the impact of the level of realism of\r\nthe virtual avatar performing the interview is on the anxiety levels\r\nof the interviewee.\r\n2 Related Work\r\nWith the rise in social interest in the fear of social interaction, North\r\n\r\net al. developed a VR therapeutic tool for the fear of public speak-\r\ning in 1998 [North et al. 1998]. This tool comprised a virtual audito-\r\nrium including audiences and audio clips that were programmed to\r\n\r\nrespond to the speaker. The study measured the level of anxiety in\r\nthe participants with self-reported questionnaires and demonstrated\r\nthe possibility of virtual reality in managing social phobia. Since\r\n\r\nthen, studies have not only shown the efficacy of virtual reality ex-\r\nposure therapy, but have also highlighted the requirement of further\r\n\r\nresearch in relation to a virtual avatar and human psych.\r\n\r\nThere have been several studies conducted to find a correlation be-\r\ntween anxiety and 3D virtual avatars in a fear stimulating virtual\r\n\r\nenvironment. Pertaub [Pertaub and C. 2001] compared the anxiety\r\nlevels of 43 people, who suffered from the fear of public speaking,\r\nand had been exposed to one of either neutral, positive or hostile 3D\r\naudiences. High levels of anxiety were induced in all participants\r\nand a less sense of satisfaction was felt by those who were exposed\r\nto the hostile audience than the others. Subsequently this research\r\nteam [Slater et al. 2004] evaluated the responses of self reported\r\nquestionnaires between phobic and non-phobic groups after they\r\nhad been exposed to either a group of virtual humans or an empty\r\nseminar room. In the result of this study, the levels of anxiety were\r\n\r\nfound to be low in the non-phobics in both situations, but signifi-\r\ncantly higher in phobics in comparison to non-phobics when they\r\n\r\nwere exposed to the empty seminar room and even higher when\r\n\r\nthey were speaking in front of a group of indifferent virtual hu-\r\nmans. Moreover, in 2003, James [James et al. 2003] presented 10\r\n\r\npeople to either a London tube or Wine bar simulation. The results\r\nof this study suggested that anxiety was generated within an overly\r\nhostile social setting despite the lack of realism of avatars.\r\nAlthough these previous studies have carried out to understand the\r\ninteraction between virtual human and anxiety felt by individuals\r\non exposure to a social interaction, it is still unclear as to how much\r\nrealism of virtual humans is required for provoking anxiety in a\r\nvirtual job interview simulation, and what the individual’s anxiety\r\noccurrence vary in between different graphic fidelity of avatar. This\r\nunderstanding might be very useful to enhance the beneficial effects\r\nto the construction of VR application for therapeutic use. The study\r\n167\r\n\r\npresented in this paper is focused primarily on the relationship be-\r\ntween the degree of anxiety and the realism of virtual human, and\r\n\r\nalso investigates the change of anxiety in accordance with virtual\r\nhuman’s attitudes during a job interview simulation. The aims were\r\n\r\napproached by the observation of individual’s eye avoidance be-\r\nhavioural tendency in different conditions of virtual environments.\r\n\r\n3 Experiment Setup\r\n\r\nFigure1 and 2 show the virtual environment that comprised a vir-\r\ntual office and the interviewer. The interviewers were designed\r\n\r\nwith three different levels of realism: a realistic 3D virtual hu-\r\nman, a cartoon-like 3D virtual human and a human photograph (See\r\n\r\nfigure2).\r\n\r\nFigure 1: The Virtual Office\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Different fidelity levels of virtual humans were used (from\r\nleft to right) Human photo (VR1), Cartoonish 3D human (VR2),\r\nand Realistic 3D human (VR3)\r\n\r\nThe human photo (VR1) was displayed as a texture. The tex-\r\nture that was used correlated to three photographs of a real in-\r\nterviewer that represented neutral, negative, and positive postures\r\n\r\n3. The model of the realistic 3D human (VR3) was created using\r\nAutodesk’s Maya software package, and rendered by the real-time\r\nrendering engine (Virtools) for a dynamic simulation. To simulate\r\n\r\nlife-like attitudes and gestures, the virtual interviewers were articu-\r\nlated figures that were modelled with a layered hierarchy: a virtual\r\n\r\nskin was attached to an underlying skeleton that animated the whole\r\nbody. The skeleton consisted of a number of segments (such as the\r\narms, fingers, and feet), which were connected to each other by\r\n\r\nthe joints. The animation of the skeleton was performed by four-\r\ndimensional matrices guided by inverse kinematics and key-frame\r\n\r\nanimation. In addition to obtain a high degree of realism for facial\r\n\r\nanimations, we used a deformation technique such as bland shape.\r\nOn the other hands, the cartoon-likes 3D human was created by the\r\nsame techniques as the VR3, but in much less detail and with a view\r\nto a cartoon artistic guidance.\r\nThe virtual interviewer asked 9 general job interview questions in\r\n\r\nany sequence to all participants.The interview questions were de-\r\nlivered by 2.1ch audio output. The interview questions were;\r\n\r\n1. What have you most enjoyed about being at university?\r\n2. Why do you want to work for us?\r\n3. Give me an example of where you have had to work on a\r\nproblem in a team.\r\n4. How do you cope under pressure? Give me an example of\r\nwhere you have had to cope in this way.\r\n5. Tell me about a time when you used your skills of persuasion\r\nto convince someone of your ideas.\r\n6. How has your work experience informed your commercial\r\nawareness?\r\n7. Tell me about a time when you made a mistake and overcame\r\nit? What did you learn from the experience?\r\n8. What newspaper do you read and why?\r\n9. Where do you see yourself in five year’s time?\r\n\r\nWhen participants were delivering their own answers to the inter-\r\nviewer, for every three questions the interviewer reacted firstly neu-\r\ntral (e.g. smiling or nodding), secondly negative (e.g. head-shaking,\r\n\r\nyawning, and turning head away with the sound of sigh, and neg-\r\native speaking ’Ok, I heard enough’) and finally positive anima-\r\ntion (smiling and interlocking fingers and interested looking with\r\n\r\npositive speaking ’That sounds interesting, could you tell me more\r\nplease’). Moreover, for interrupting the continuity of participants’\r\nanswers, if it was too long, we implemented several breaking-off\r\nsounds such as e.g. Thanks for your answer or Ok, I am going to go\r\nto the next question. All the selection of the sounds and animations\r\nwere able to be operated by the investigator at any time during the\r\njob interview (See figure3)\r\nTo compromise between real time constraints and visual quality, we\r\n\r\nused Virtools (VR-engine) that allowed us to develop fully inter-\r\nactive VR environment with a built in behaviour rendering engine\r\n\r\n(Shaders 3.0, HLSL and CgFX, DX 9.c and OpenGL 2.0) and pre-\r\nscripted module (Behaviour Building Block). Although the SDK\r\n\r\nis less flexible to create complex custom behaviours and access the\r\nAPI, it has been adopted a graphical interface with drag and drop\r\nprogramming method for a less technical software developer. The\r\n3D models that designed by Maya software were directly exported\r\n\r\nto Virtools using Maya-Virtools export plug-in, and then the 3D ob-\r\njects were reassigned a materials and textures, and redefined char-\r\nacter animations and sounds to be controlled by input devices (e.g.\r\n\r\nkeyboard and mouse). The developed virtual job interview simu-\r\nlation was rendered by NVIDIA Geforce 8800 GT with the reso-\r\nlution mode of 1280X800X32@60Hz, and presented in a 57 inch\r\n\r\nLCD TV. As described at figure 4, the VR system was synchronised\r\nto an eye tracking system through User Datagram Protocol(UDP)\r\nnetwork for recording animation event time accurately. Two video\r\ncameras were utilised one for recording subject’s facial ex<x>pression\r\nand the other one for recording subject’s vision that combined with\r\neye tracker. (See Figure 4).\r\nIt is well known that the escape and avoidance behaviours are\r\nwidely applied in social anxiety. In particular, the avoidance of\r\n\r\neye contact is the one of the major symptoms among socially anx-\r\nious people. Moreover, the eye contact is the one of the imperative\r\n\r\n168\r\n\r\nFigure 3: The examples of different reactions of virtual humans\r\nwere used (from Top to Bottom) Neutral, Positive, and Negative\r\ninfluences on a job interview. The frequent of eye-contact elicits\r\npositive interviewer evaluations and interview outcomes [Stevens\r\n\r\nand Kristof 1995]. Nevertheless, most population experience anx-\r\niety and not easy to maintain eye contact during a job interview,\r\n\r\nparticularly with strangers and even more whose are in a position\r\nof authority [Hollandsworth et al. 1978]. Furthermore, the rate of\r\neye-blink has been found to increase when anxiety, stress or arousal\r\n\r\nis experienced [Harrigan and O’Connell 1996]. The increased eye-\r\nblink is associated with increased sympathetic nervous system ac-\r\ntivity, and increases in both are related to participants’ attempts to\r\n\r\nsuppress felt emotion [Gross and Levenson 1993]. These anxiety\r\nbehaviour tendencies can be measured by an eye tracker, and it has\r\nbeen validated by Glilion [Grillon et al. 2006] and Horley [Horley\r\net al. 2003]. We thus focused more on subject’s eye behaviours and\r\nutilised a Facelab’s eye tracker, a web camera (800 × 600) and a\r\nvideo recorder (6mm digital) in order to observe and measure the\r\ngaze avoidance behaviours of subjects including gaze movement,\r\nblinking and other symptoms related to the response of avoidance\r\nbehaviour.\r\nAfter collecting the time each subject spent with their gaze fixed\r\non the interviewer’s face in the general eyes and mouth area, we\r\ncalculated the percent rate of gaze fixation during each question by\r\nthe following equation:\r\nRGF =\r\n\r\nTime o f GF\r\nETimeo f Q−STimeo f Q\r\n×100\r\n\r\n, where\r\n• RGF: The percent rate of gaze fixation\r\n• Time of GF: the time each subject’s of gaze fixation on the\r\ninterviewer’s face\r\n• ETime of Q: the end of time in each question\r\n\r\n• STime of Q: the start of time in each question\r\nSimilarly, the percent rate of blinking in each job interview question\r\nwas also calculated by the equation:\r\nREB =\r\n\r\nNumber o f EB\r\nETimeo f Q−STimeo f Q\r\n×100\r\n\r\n, where\r\n• REB: The percent rate of eye blink\r\n• Number of EB: The number of each subject’s of eye blink\r\n• ETime of Q: the end of time in each question\r\n• STime of Q: the start of time in each question\r\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) test as a major statistical analysis\r\nmethod was used to evaluate the mean difference for dependent\r\n\r\nvariables (RGF and REB) in various VR conditions of virtual hu-\r\nman. To ensure the level of confidence the mean comparisons for\r\n\r\ndifferent levels of independent variables were done by using a mul-\r\ntiple comparison procedure with Scheffe correction.\r\n\r\nFigure 4: The Architecture of Experiment Setup\r\n\r\n4 Results\r\nSixty volunteer subjects (29 male and 31 female) were recruited\r\nfrom the university students with following ethnic backgrounds\r\nage 21-34 (mean=25.95 and SD=2.84), 47 Asian (Thai, Chinese,\r\n\r\nJapanese, Indian, and Korean) and 13 European (French, Span-\r\nish, Italian, Slovakian, Norwegian, and British). All participants\r\n\r\nwere equivalently allocated into three different groups for expo-\r\nsure: Realistic 3D virtual human (VR3), cartoon-like 3D virtual\r\n\r\nhuman (VR2), and human photograph (VR1). Two self-reported\r\nquestionnaires: Brief Fear of Negative Evaluation Scale (BFNE)\r\n[Leary 1983] and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSA)[Liebowitz\r\n1987] were implemented as a screening instrument to identify the\r\nseverity of participant’s anxiety in real life. The total average score\r\nin each scale was 24.33 out of total 60 in BFNES and 52.95 out of\r\ntotal 144 in LSAS. The scores were not met to diagnosis any social\r\nanxiety tendency, and the average scores of both scales in between\r\ngroups were not different at 5% level of significance.\r\n169\r\n\r\n4.1 The sequence of gaze fixation\r\nWe characterised the anxiety during the interviews via the times\r\n\r\nsubjects spent fixating on the virtual interviewer’s face, i.e. the sub-\r\nject’s gaze fixation. This was further discussed in Section 3. The\r\n\r\nfollowing graphs clearly describe how the mean value of the rate of\r\ngaze fixation (MRGF) varies according to each question during the\r\nwhole virtual job interview session.\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Mean of RGF in VR1 (2D photograph interviewer)\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Mean of RGF in VR2 (3D cartoonish interviewer)\r\n\r\nFigure 7: Mean of RGF in VR3 (3D human interviewer)\r\nFirst we studied the participant’s response for the percent rate gaze\r\nfixation time (RGF) in interviews with a human photo (VR1). The\r\nRGF at which the participants looked at the interviewer’s face was\r\nchanging over time. The mean more than doubled (2.6) during the\r\n\r\nfirst three neutral questions when the participant looked at the neu-\r\ntral photograph. Then the gaze rate was slowly decreasing during\r\n\r\nthe session when the participant had to face an interviewer’s photo\r\n\r\nwith negative face. In addition, the mean of the RGF was slowly de-\r\ncreased to -0.13 for the rest of responses (positive reaction) during\r\n\r\nlast three questions.\r\nA similar tendency of results was found in VR3. Although there\r\nwas a slight difference in gradient, it showed a clear decline in the\r\nmean of RGF for the whole three interviewers between the 4th and\r\n6th questions, where virtual interviewers reacted negatively. From\r\nthe graphs, we observed that all types of virtual interviewer had\r\nsuccessfully elicited a reduction in time participants spent with their\r\ngaze fixation on interviewer’s face when the interviewer performed\r\nnegative reactions. It appeared that across all virtual avatars, the 3D\r\nhuman tended to have strongest effect on the participant’s anxiety\r\nduring the negative session. The participants’ gaze fixation percent\r\nrate showed the greatest drop, indicating the highest anxiety level\r\n(face avoidance).\r\nWe tested via ANOVA whether the observed differences for RGF\r\n\r\nacross interviewer’s types were statistically significant. The aver-\r\nage of RGF are 22.44, 23.34, and 21.61, during a interview with\r\n\r\nthe type of VR1, VR2 and VR3 avatar respectively. Although\r\nVR3 elicited the lowest average of RGF amongst the three avatars,\r\nthe differences between them were not found to be significant\r\n(p=0.538) at 5% level of significance.\r\nNext, we wanted to confirm that the negative reaction of virtual\r\n\r\ninterviewer decreases a participant’s gaze fixation time. We com-\r\npared the mean RGF in the three types of virtual interviewer’s reac-\r\ntion and evaluated them by the ANOVA test. We found strong evi-\r\ndence that gaze rate (RGF) significantly changed across three types\r\n\r\nof interviewer’s reactions (p=0.029). Using a multiple comparison\r\nprocedure with Scheffe correction we found that the participants\r\nlooked at interviewer’s face least often during the negative session\r\n(mean = 20.4). This was significantly smaller (p=0.013) than the\r\n\r\ngaze rate during neutral (mean=24.5) and positive (mean=22.4) ses-\r\nsions. Further, no significant difference (p=0.999) in mean of RGF\r\n\r\nwas found between neutral and positive sessions at the 5% level of\r\nsignificance.\r\nSince the mean RGF was found to be different across interviewer’s\r\nreaction types, we next investigated if this property of mean RGF\r\n\r\nwas shared for each of the virtual interviewer. We therefore eval-\r\nuated the mean difference of RGF between interviewer’s reaction\r\n\r\ntypes for each virtual avatar separately. ANOVA test confirmed\r\nthat VR3 was the only condition where RGF differed between the\r\nnegative and neutral reaction (p=0.001) at 5% level of significance,\r\nTable 1.\r\n(I) Reaction (J) Reaction Mean Diff.(I-J) Std.

Furthermore we discovered that participants tended\r\nto avoid eye contacts more with the realistic 3D interviewer, when\r\nthe interviewer gave negative reactions.\r\n170\r\n\r\n4.2 Frequency of eye blink\r\nEye blinking is another relevant measure of anxiety: the more a\r\nparticipant is stressed and the more he/she blinks. We calculated\r\n\r\nthe average of blinking percent rate (REB) during each of inter-\r\nviewer’s reactions (Neutral, Negative and Positive) and compared\r\n\r\nthem across the different levels of realism (VR1, VR2 and VR3) via\r\nan ANOVA test. This would provide important evidence to identify\r\nwhether the avoidance eye behaviour during the interview session\r\nwas caused by anxiety. The following graphs shows how the mean\r\nof REB varies when participants were exposed to the virtual job\r\ninterview.\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Mean of REB in VR1 (2D photograph interviewer)\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Mean of REB in VR2 (3D cartoon interviewer)\r\n\r\nFigure 10: Mean of REB in VR3 (3D human interviewer)\r\nFrom the graphs, the value of the mean REB shows very similar\r\ncurves over the different types of virtual interviewer. In all VRs\r\n\r\nthe blinking rate was low between the 1st and 3rd; and between the\r\n7th and 9th question. This suggests whether the negative virtual\r\ninterviewer tended to elicit higher frequency of eye blinks, which\r\nwere are a sign of higher anxiety.\r\nIn order to explore this tendency with statistical analysis, we first\r\nstudied the differences of REB across VR1, VR2 and VR3. The\r\nmean of eye blinking percent rates were 36.22, 37.70 and 37.15\r\n\r\nduring the whole job interview session for VR1, VR2 and VR3 re-\r\nspectively. These differences were found not to be significant at\r\n\r\nthe 5% level. Next, in order to identify whether there is a mean\r\ndifference for REB within the three types of reaction of the virtual\r\ninterviewer, an ANOVA test was computed. The mean of REB was\r\nhigher for negative (M. negative = 38.34) reactions than for other\r\ntypes (M. positive = 35.78 and M. neutral = 36.95), however, only\r\nthe mean difference between the positive and negative (p=0.000)\r\nreactions was significant at the 5% level of significance. Therefore,\r\n\r\nwe repeated the ANOVA test to see whether it showed the same re-\r\nsult in each type of virtual interviewer. In the case of VR1 or VR2,\r\n\r\nthere was no mean difference for REB among the type of reaction.\r\nHowever, the mean difference for REB was significant (p=0.03) in\r\nthe group of VR3, see Table 2. This comparison showed that only\r\n\r\nthe 3D human interviewer induced the increase in REB when it per-\r\nformed negatively.\r\n\r\n(I) Reaction (J) Reaction Mean Diff.(I-J) Std.

In order to investigate our hy-\r\npothesis, we developed three varying levels of realistic fidelity of\r\n\r\nthe virtual interviewer. Participants were exposed to a virtual job\r\ninterview situation with nine job interview questions. During the\r\n\r\njob interview, we simulated the virtual interviewer providing neu-\r\ntral, negative, and positive reactions. After comparing the mean\r\n\r\ndifference for the percent rate of gaze fixation and eye blinking, we\r\ngenerally noticed that the anxiety level was affected more by the\r\nattitude of the virtual interviewer than its level of realism.\r\nFrom the results of our experiment, we have three main findings.\r\nFirst, we could not find any significant difference in the mean for\r\n\r\na participant’s gaze fixation rate and eye blinking rate together be-\r\ntween the varying levels of virtual interviewer fidelity. However, we\r\n\r\nidentified that the mean for both responses was significant when the\r\n\r\nparticipants were interviewed with the negative performing 3D hu-\r\nman interviewer. Based on these results, we could conclude the re-\r\nalism of virtual avatar may be related to anxiety levels, but it seems\r\n\r\nthe high fidelity of virtual reality is not a critical factor in increasing\r\nthe anxiety levels in a virtual environment.\r\nSecondly, participants responded similarly in both gaze fixation rate\r\n\r\nand eye blinking rate to a virtual interviewer’s neutral and posi-\r\ntive reactions, and the mean difference was not significant between\r\n\r\nthem. This can be interpreted in that either we failed to design\r\npure positive reactions , or that participants were more concerned\r\n171\r\n\r\nabout the interviewer’s negative reaction than neutral or positive re-\r\nactions. However, we could not find any evidences from the result\r\n\r\nof this study to evaluate this assumption, so this issue is open for\r\nfurther investigation.\r\n\r\nFinally, measuring an individual’s eye behaviour may be a promis-\r\ning tool to identify the anxiety level while people are exposed to\r\n\r\na virtual social simulation. The eye tracker gave us very detailed\r\nvisual results and allowed us to acquire a qualitative appraisal of an\r\nindividual’s eye behaviour. In addition, we found that the response\r\n\r\nof blinking was a more sensitive tool than gaze avoidance. Fur-\r\nthermore, we observed that the blinking response increased within\r\n\r\na few seconds after participant was exposed to anxiety stimulating\r\nevents.\r\n6 Conclusions\r\nWe can conclude that the visual realism of avatar used in the job\r\ninterview simulation may be related to a less eye-contact and more\r\n\r\nrate of blinking, but this tendency of anxiety behaviour is more re-\r\nlated to the attitudes of virtual humans. This conclusion might con-\r\nsolidate to Pertaub’s finding [Pertaub and C. 2001] that participants\r\n\r\nfelt more comfortable with a positive group of avatars and experi-\r\nenced substantial distress with an unpleasant audience. In addition,\r\n\r\nthis result should contribute to the development of more effective\r\nvirtual reality exposure therapy for social anxiety disorders.\r\nIn the future we will evaluate the relationship between other types\r\nof interaction from the virtual avatar and the environment itself,\r\nincluding voice tone or speech, smell and lighting and its affect on\r\nthe social anxiety of the participant. We will also consider other\r\nphysiological measurements such as Electroencephalography and\r\nElectromyography for facial emotion.\r\n7 Acknowledgement\r\nWe would like to thank Dr. Jenny O’leary (The Centre of Warwick\r\n\r\nCareer Service) for her contributions (see avatar photograph), use-\r\nful comments and suggestions throughout the study.'),

Some pioneering companies have deployed innova-\r\ntive features to provide “live help” that assists online shoppers when they search\r\n\r\nfor specific merchandise and that answers shoppers’ questions instantly through\r\nreal-time communications with sales associates.\r\nLive help is distinguished from other online customer-support functions in that\r\nit involves real employees providing assistance to customers (Aberg & Shahmehri,\r\n\r\n2003). Currently, most live help services are implemented through instant text chat-\r\nting between shoppers and customer service representatives (CSRs). These conver-\r\nsations can be initiated either by a customer or by a CSR who engages customers\r\n\r\nproactively by greeting them and inviting them to chat online. Notably, instant in-\r\nteractions in this form have been identified as an important factor bolstering\r\n\r\nLands’ End’s e-commerce success (Dukcevich, 2002); the average value of an order\r\n\r\nincreases by 6% when a potential customer uses the live help function, and an on-\r\nline visitor who uses Lands’ End’s instant messaging is 20% more likely to com-\r\nplete a purchase than one who does not.\r\n\r\nThis study focuses primarily on the interface design of live help features pro-\r\nvided by online shopping Web sites. Although significant progress has been made\r\n\r\nwith real-time multimedia collaboration technologies, which have proved helpful\r\nin some shopping environments, it is still not clear whether these technologies are\r\nmore effective than text-only instant chatting. The vividness and sensory depth of\r\nWeb site interfaces and consumer experiences, encompassed in the term media\r\nrichness, is enhanced by relatively low-cost multimedia and virtual reality (VR)\r\n\r\ntechnology that is currently available, particularly text-to-speech (TTS) voice tech-\r\nnology and three-dimensional (3D) avatars. However, before justifying and imple-\r\nmenting these technologies based solely on intuition and common sense, their im-\r\npact on users’ perceptions of their communication with e-vendors deserves a\r\n\r\ncareful and detailed investigation.\r\nKiesler, Zubrow, and Moses (1985) found that when two people meet for the first\r\ntime and exchange a series of questions to become familiar with one another, those\r\nwho communicate by computer evaluate each other less favorably than those who\r\ncommunicate face to face. Computer-mediated communication feels and acts as\r\nthough the setting is more impersonal, leading to more inhibited communication\r\n\r\nbehavior. Similar arguments have been identified in computer-mediated commu-\r\nnication (CMC) literature, where the term social presence is often used to describe\r\n\r\nthe degree to which a mediated experience is perceived as real rather than medi-\r\nated (Lombard & Ditton, 1997). According to Short, Williams, and Christie (1976),\r\n\r\nvisual media involve greater social presence than verbal (audio) media, which in\r\nturn have greater social presence than written media. In the context of electronic\r\nshopping, these findings imply that the initial trust between online consumers and\r\n\r\nremote CSRs is even more difficult to nurture and develop compared with interac-\r\ntions that take place in a physical store.\r\n\r\nWould multimedia and multimodal communication interfaces make a differ-\r\nence? Could an interface with a higher level of media richness enhance consumer\r\n\r\ntrust toward a CSR? These are the questions investigated in the current study.\r\nThe next section of this article discusses the role of trust in electronic commerce\r\nand introduces the potential effects of TTS voice and animated embodiments in\r\n76 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\ncommunication interfaces (avatars); the research model and hypotheses are pre-\r\nsented thereafter. Section 3 describes the experimental design and methods used\r\n\r\nduring the data collection phase of the study, and Sections 4 and 5 summarize and\r\ndiscuss the results. Finally, Section 6 discusses the implications, limitations, and\r\nconclusions of the study, as well as suggestions for future research.\r\n2. LITERATURE REVIEW AND RESEARCH MODEL\r\n2.1. Consumer Trust\r\nIn traditional commerce, the objects of trust can be either a company (including, for\r\nexample, the working partnership between a manufacturer firm and a distributor\r\n\r\nfirm) or a salesperson (when the major means of reaching a bargain is through per-\r\nsonal selling). In studies of personal selling and sales management, the concept of\r\n\r\nrelationship quality, which to a great extent determines future sales opportunities\r\n(Crosby, Evans, & Cowles, 1990), is composed of two dimensions: (a) trust in a\r\nsalesperson (Swan & Trawick, 1988) and (b) satisfaction with a salesperson (Crosby\r\n& Stephens, 1987). Furthermore, Crosby et al. (1990) posited that consumer trust in\r\n\r\na salesperson has two components: affect, the feelings of security or insecurity as-\r\nsociated with reliance on a salesperson, and cognition, the belief that a salesperson\r\n\r\nhas both the necessary competence and sufficient motivation to be relied on reason-\r\nably. Komiak and Benbasat (2004) further refined this definition of trust by refer-\r\nring to affect as emotional trust and expanding it to encompass a customer’s feel-\r\nings about relying on an entity, while dividing the cognitive components of trust\r\n\r\ninto (a) cognitive trust in the competence of a salesperson and (b) cognitive trust in\r\nthe goodwill of a salesperson.\r\nPrior research on online consumer trust has focused primarily on consumers’\r\ntrust toward either a Web site or a company (e.g., Gefen & Straub, 2003; Hoffman,\r\nNovak, & Peralta, 1999; McKnight, Choudhury, & Kacmar, 2002). In these studies,\r\ntrust has been defined from four major perspectives: (a) a belief or a collection of\r\nbeliefs (Bhattacherjee, 2002), (b) emotional feelings (Komiak & Benbasat, 2004), (c)\r\nan intention (Mayer & Davis, 1995), and (d) a combination of these elements\r\n(McKnight et al., 2002).\r\nIn this research, the approach taken by McKnight et al. (2002) was adopted,\r\ntreating both trusting beliefs and intentions as integral components of trust. In this\r\ncontext, trusting beliefs are defined as an individual’s perception that someone or\r\nsomething they trust has attributes that may generate benefits for them. This study\r\napplies this framework specifically to interpersonal trust; that is, a customer’s\r\ntrusting beliefs toward a CSR who provides him or her with live help and compares\r\n\r\nthis trust in online environments to consumer trust toward salespeople in tradi-\r\ntional commerce.\r\n\r\nAs discussed by Bhattacherjee (2002) and McKnight et al. (2002), there are three\r\ntrust-related attributes of a CSR who is the object of trust: (a) the competence of the\r\ntrustee, designating the ability of the trustee to do what the trustor needs, (b) the\r\ntrustee’s benevolence, denoting the trustee’s care and motivation to act in the\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 77\r\n\r\ntrustor’s interests, and (c) the trustee’s integrity, encompassing the honesty of the\r\n\r\ntrustee and the reliability of his or her promises. In as much as the live help simu-\r\nlated in this study plays only a passive role of answering users’ questions on prod-\r\nuct attributes, service policies, or Web site navigation, consumer beliefs regarding\r\n\r\nthe benevolence and integrity of the CSR providing the help are less salient. There-\r\nfore, this research concentrates on consumers’ trusting beliefs about the compe-\r\ntence of the CSR. Furthermore, as users’ trusting beliefs develop and change\r\n\r\nthrough their repeated experiences beyond initial interactions with an agent (also\r\nknown as “experienced credibility;” Tseng & Fogg, 1999), this study focuses on the\r\ninitial formation of trust.\r\nIn addition to investigating cognitive trust regarding the competence of a CSR,\r\n\r\nthe study also assesses whether users’ emotional trust is influenced by different in-\r\nterface components. Previous studies have argued that affect indeed plays an im-\r\nportant role in human-computer interactions (Hudlicka, 2003). Specifically, re-\r\nsearch in social psychology has demonstrated that emotions not only directly\r\n\r\ndetermine users’ affective states but also interact with their cognitive perceptions.\r\nPositive affective states can promote heuristic processing by consumers (Clore,\r\n\r\n1994) and increase their estimates of their own level of control over their environ-\r\nments (Isen, 1993). Among the various factors that could influence users’ affective\r\n\r\nstates, this study focuses on those stimulated by hedonic interface components.\r\nThe inclusion of hedonic information—for example, animated images, appealing\r\nvisual layouts, and multimedia contents—in a hedonic information system, such as\r\nan electronic commerce Web site, can directly influence shoppers’ perceptions of\r\nenjoyment, which is considered as a more important factor to encourage use than\r\nutilitarian goals such as perceived usefulness (Van der Heijden, 2004).\r\nDeveloping from these findings, this study investigates consumer trust from\r\nboth cognitive and emotional perspectives.\r\n2.2. Trust in Computer-Mediated Communications\r\nConsidering that live help is a Web-based and mediated form of communication, the\r\n\r\ncurrent study is informed by trust-related research in the fields of computer-sup-\r\nported collaborative work and computer-mediated communication (CMC).\r\n\r\nIn the field of CMC, studies of different communication media have proposed a\r\nset of characteristics by which media can be categorized and assessed and by which\r\n\r\nthe impacts of these characteristics on users’ attitudes toward any particular me-\r\ndium can be investigated (see e.g., Daft & Lengel, 1986; Dennis & Valacich, 1999;\r\n\r\nRice, 1992; Short et al., 1976; Walther, 1992). Among these characteristics, one of the\r\nmost significant factors is modality, the capacity of a medium to convey multiple\r\ncues simultaneously, as addressed by media richness theories (Daft & Lengel, 1984)\r\nand social presence theories (Short et al., 1976).\r\n\r\nSocial scientists have long observed that interpersonal interactions involve com-\r\nmunication of both verbal and nonverbal signals. For example, a variety of research\r\n\r\nhas demonstrated that nonverbal cues, such as expressiveness in someone’s eyes,\r\nspeech hesitations, gestures, clothing, and posture, are found to influence selected\r\n78 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\ndimensions of buyers’ initial perceptions of a salesperson and their evaluations of a\r\nvideotaped sales presentation (Leigh & Summers, 2002). Consumers’ impressions\r\nof the nonverbal cues from a CSR can thus make a significant difference in their\r\n\r\nevaluation of the CSR, especially during a first-time encounter when no past expe-\r\nrience or third-party testimonies can be consulted.\r\n\r\nThe absence of nonverbal social cues in CMC can simultaneously exert a consid-\r\nerable impact on consumer perceptions of communication quality, according to\r\n\r\nother CMC research (e.g., Bordia, 1997), in as much as social cues can foster more\r\n\r\npositive impressions than can be conveyed through more stark media. Some stud-\r\nies have suggested that depersonalized forms of communication may lead to psy-\r\nchological distance, which in turn may affect the disposition of the impressions\r\n\r\nthus formed (Rutter, 1987).\r\nIn delivering messages and associated cues toward meaning, some researchers\r\n\r\nhave found that interpersonal trust is likely to be affected by the media and modal-\r\nity used for communication. For example, Bos, Olson, Gergle, Olson, and Wright\r\n\r\n(2002) studied the emergence of trust in four different communication situations:\r\nface to face, video, audio, and text chat. They found that the first three (i.e., richer)\r\n\r\nconditions were significantly more effective than text chatting. The video and au-\r\ndio conferencing test participant group exhibited almost as many positive effects as\r\n\r\nthe face-to-face participants. Similarly, Greenspan, Goldberg, Weimer, and Basso\r\n\r\n(2000) used a controlled experiment to study prospective homebuyers who se-\r\nlected houses using the Web, telephone, and PhoneChannel interfaces (combining\r\n\r\ntelephones and televisions). Their results demonstrated that telephones and the\r\nPhoneChannel can lead to higher levels of trust. E.-J. Lee, Lee, and Schumann\r\n(2002) demonstrated that conversational information (communicated through\r\nface-to-face or telephone interactions) is perceived to be more useful than written\r\ninformation when customers are learning about innovations.\r\nIn online environments, the most prevalent communication modality is text.\r\n\r\nE-mail, instant messaging, and discussion forums have been widely used to facili-\r\ntate communication between online shoppers and vendors. Although voice chan-\r\nnels, such as vendor-supported “1-800” telephone numbers and Internet calls\r\n\r\nthrough VoIP, also are available through some Web sites, most small- and me-\r\ndium-sized vendors cannot afford dedicated call centers and service staff.\r\n\r\nReal-time video conferencing is even rarer. Besides the technical constraints, such\r\nas transmission bandwidth and video compression, the other concern of live help\r\nproviders is that the provision of audio and video output makes a CSR unable to\r\n\r\nmultitask. With text messaging, a CSR can interact with several shoppers simulta-\r\nneously, which significantly reduces the running cost while maintaining satisfac-\r\ntory response latency.\r\n\r\n2.3. TTS Voice\r\n\r\nThe first independent variable investigated in this study was the mode of informa-\r\ntion presentation applied in live help. In particular, the different modes examined\r\n\r\nwere text, speech by a TTS synthesizer, and their combination. A TTS synthesizer is\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 79\r\n\r\na computer-based system designed to read text aloud (Dutoit, 1997). The funda-\r\nmental difference between a TTS system and any other talking machine (e.g. a cas-\r\nsette player) is the ability of the former to automatically produce new sentences. In\r\n\r\nother words, the TTS system does not simply use concatenations of isolated words\r\nor parts of sentences, but rather it automatically produces speech through a\r\ngrapheme-to-phoneme transcription of sentences (Dutoit, 1997).\r\n\r\nCompared with prerecorded human speech, TTS systems are highly flexible, be-\r\ncause speech is generated on the fly, and the systems “produce” almost infinitive\r\n\r\narrays of contents. Previous successful applications of these systems on various\r\n\r\nWeb sites have provided information access, customer-ordering functions, infor-\r\nmation for drivers, and interfaces for disabled users. They are implemented widely\r\n\r\nin the area of automated voice response services, interactive voice response sys-\r\ntems, computer games, intelligent agents, and VR environments.\r\n\r\nConversely, the TTS voice systems currently available still have some intrinsic\r\ndeficiencies, because they lack the quality and prosody of natural human speech. A\r\n\r\ncomparative study (Beutnagel, Conkie, Schroeter, Stylianou, & Syrdal, 1999) dem-\r\nonstrated that the current TTS systems perform fairly successfully in terms of intel-\r\nligibility, but they are still not satisfactory in their level of naturalness. Com-\r\nputer-generated voices tend to have unnatural pauses, accents, and word\r\n\r\nemphases, as well as discontinuities between phonemes and syllables (Nass & Lee,\r\n2001). Even with the best TTS synthesizers on the market, such as AT&T’s Natural\r\n\r\nVoices, it is still quite easy for users to distinguish the synthesizer from the low-\r\nest-fidelity presentation of human speech.\r\n\r\nSomeresearchhasbeenconductedtoexploreconsumerresponsestosuch“unnat-\r\nural” machine voices. Among them, a series of studies (E.-J. Lee, Nass, & Brave, 2000;\r\n\r\nK. Lee & Nass, 2003; Nass & Lee, 2000, 2001) have investigated whether participants\r\nwould attribute social responses to computer-generated voices and found that users\r\n\r\nuse social cues even when they know that the voice speaking to them does not origi-\r\nnate from a real person. For example, when the perceived personality traits of a com-\r\nputer voice match those of the users’, the voice is generally regarded as more attrac-\r\ntive, credible, and informative than those “mismatch” ones; even the products\r\n\r\npresented by a “match” computer voice are evaluated more positively than the ones\r\nintroduced by a “mismatch” TTS voice (K. Lee & Nass, 2003; Nass & Lee, 2001).\r\n\r\nJensen, Farnham, Drucker, and Kollock (2000), after comparing four forms of com-\r\nmunication,foundthatTTSvoiceapplicationsareperceivedsignificantlymoreposi-\r\ntively than text-only interactions, contrary to their predictions that TTS voice tech-\r\nnology might lack cues that people use in predicting the veracity of utterances.\r\n\r\n2.4. Animated Embodiment and 3D Avatars\r\n\r\nThe second independent variable in live help interfaces is the use of animated em-\r\nbodiments (implemented with 3D avatars) to represent CSRs during the course of\r\n\r\ncommunication. The term avatar refers to a 2D or 3D virtual image that symbolizes\r\n\r\nthe users and the CSRs. Two issues are of primary importance to the successful im-\r\nplementation of an avatar: function and representation.\r\n\r\n80 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\nIn terms of their functionality, avatars have been used in collaborative virtual en-\r\nvironments to represent users’ presence, orientation, and location. Salem and Earle\r\n\r\n(2000) proposed that avatars also could be used to facilitate communications be-\r\ntween users. In this study, the avatar integrated in an online shopping Web site was\r\n\r\nused to represent the image of a CSR.\r\nAccording to Salem and Earle (2000, p. 94), avatars can be realistic, abstract, or\r\nnaturalistic in the form of their representation:\r\n• Realistic avatars are designed to provide accurate representations of users, for\r\nexample, real-time video images captured by a video camera may be used as the\r\nface of an avatar. However, this implementation is constrained by certain technical\r\nfactors, such as network bandwidth and computational power of users’ computers.\r\n\r\n• Abstract avatars use cartoon images or fictitious entities, for example an ani-\r\nmated talking dog or even a paper clip. Although these implementations have long\r\n\r\nbeen used in software-powered interface agents, notably in Microsoft Office, their\r\n\r\neffectiveness in supporting human-to-human communication has not been dem-\r\nonstrated empirically.\r\n\r\n• Naturalistic avatars are usually humanoid in form, but with a degraded level\r\nof detail. This type of avatar can emulate natural protocols just enough to achieve\r\nrecognition of familiar features, like a smile, a waving hand, and a nodding head.\r\nThis type of avatar was chosen not only because it is technically feasible, both in\r\nthis study and in the context of the current constraints of Internet connectivity\r\n\r\nfaced by most consumers, but also because it preserves the multimodal communi-\r\ncation and conventional conversational habits of face-to-face interaction. The use\r\n\r\nof nonverbal communication capabilities, facial ex<x>pressions, hand gestures, and\r\nbody postures can be perceived and understood easily by consumers while at the\r\nsame time enriching their interactive experiences.\r\n2.5. Hypotheses\r\n\r\nCompared with face-to-face conversation, electronically mediated forms of com-\r\nmunication, including telephony, video telephony, instant messaging, and e-mail,\r\n\r\nprovide less feedback to people who are speaking and fewer sensory cues to people\r\nlistening. With the addition of TTS voice and 3D avatars, consumers are exposed to\r\nmore audio–visual communication cues. Furthermore, when a user interacts with a\r\n\r\nhuman-like virtual character that talks and moves in a vividly simulated audio–vi-\r\nsual environment, more sensory cues are involved and perceived. On the basis of\r\n\r\nprevious research on social presence, it is expected that higher levels of vividness,\r\ndetermined by the number of sensory channels that a medium appeals to (Short et\r\nal., 1976) and the quality of the medium’s sensory fidelity (Reeves & Nass, 1996),\r\n\r\nenhance the degree to which senses are engaged, consequently increasing per-\r\nceived levels of social presence, which is defined as the extent to which an individ-\r\nual psychologically perceives other people to be physically present when interact-\r\ning with them (Short et al., 1976). Gefen and Straub (2003) demonstrated that social\r\n\r\npresence can affect consumer trust. Hence, for shoppers who lack product exper-\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 81\r\n\r\ntise or experiences of interacting with a CSR, it is very likely that a greater degree of\r\nsocial presence would permit higher levels of trust toward a CSR.\r\nSpeech carries much richer information than the literal meaning of the content of\r\nthe words that are spoken. For example, as Scherer (2003) observed, voice is as\r\n\r\ngood as facial ex<x>pressions to convey emotions. People also can perceive social sta-\r\ntus, personality, and attitudes in others’ speech style (Giles & Powesland, 1975). Al-\r\nthough the AT&T Natural Voices TTS system used in this study is still far from sat-\r\nisfactory in its degree of naturalness compared with a real human voice, it can\r\n\r\nconvey some prosodic features, such as intonation and phrasing, by selecting units\r\nfrom a large speech inventory that best matches the prosody predicted by the TTS\r\nsystem (Jilka, Syrdal, Conkie, & Kapilow, 2003). Therefore, it is posited that when\r\nlive help information is presented with TTS voice, a CSR will be perceived as more\r\ntrustworthy than when only textual information is used.\r\n\r\nConversely, when audio output and textual output are presented simulta-\r\nneously, the redundant information from both channels may render one of them\r\n\r\nless salient, as well as causing distraction and information overload. In most cur-\r\nrent text-based instant messaging protocols, each unit of “chatting message” is\r\n\r\ntransferred only when a user clicks the “send” button; as a consequence, the whole\r\nblock of the message is displayed on the receiving party’s computer screen almost\r\ninstantly. In comparison, even though TTS voice is generated on the client side,\r\nwhich means no delay is caused by the encoding/transferring/decoding process\r\nof audio signals, the playback of audio output still takes more time than the display\r\nof textual information on the monitor. In other words, when both text and voice are\r\nprovided, it will be more immediate for users to read the text on the monitor than to\r\nlisten to the same content through an audio channel. Therefore, the delayed audio\r\noutput, as well as the potential social cues embedded in it, might be largely ignored\r\n\r\nand considered to be redundant. For this reason, it is anticipated that live help in-\r\nformation presented with TTS voice only would make the CSR more trustworthy\r\n\r\nthan when both textual and audible output are presented.\r\n\r\nBased on this discussion, it is expected that live help in a “TTS voice only” condi-\r\ntion will lead to higher cognitive trust and emotional trust than both “text only”\r\n\r\nand “TTS voice + text” conditions. Because the goal of this study was to identify the\r\nbest practices for TTS implementation, interest is not in the comparison between\r\nthe “text only” and “TTS voice + text” conditions, because both are expected to be\r\ninferior to “TTS voice only.”\r\nH1a: Live help presented with “TTS voice only” will lead to a higher level of\r\ncognitive trust in the CSR than Live Help with “text only.”\r\nH1b: Live help presented with “TTS voice only” will lead to a higher level\r\nof emotional trust in the CSR than live help with “text only.”\r\nH2a: Live help presented with “TTS voice only” will lead to a higher level\r\nof cognitive trust in the CSR than live help with “TTS voice + text.”\r\nH2b: Live help presented with “TTS voice only” will lead to a higher level\r\nof emotional trust in the CSR than live help with “TTS voice + text.”\r\nIn a physical store, when a consumer talks with a salesperson for the first time,\r\nthat person judges the serviceperson’s expertise and trustworthiness not only\r\n82 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\nbased on the content of the communication but also influenced by other peripheral\r\ncues such as the salesperson’s physical attractiveness, age, and interaction style.\r\nResearch in marketing has found that heightened physical attractiveness generally\r\n\r\nenhances one’s effectiveness as a social influence agent (Chaiken, 1981); particu-\r\nlarly attractive faces are found to be effective in improving people’s responses to\r\n\r\nadvertisements (Baker & Churchill Jr., 1977). These findings coincide with an argu-\r\nment raised by Tseng and Fogg (1999) that people often believe someone or some-\r\nthing based on “surface credibility,” determined by simple inspections of the per-\r\nson or thing. One study into the effects of static images of human beings\r\n\r\n(Riegelsberger, Sasse, & McCarthy, 2003) found that photographs of staff members\r\non an e-commerce Web site can increase the perceived trustworthiness of poorly\r\nperforming vendors.\r\n\r\nThe naturalistic 3D avatar built on the Blaxxun Contact platform, although a rel-\r\natively crude and simple representation of a communicator, is able to generate sev-\r\neral common gestures, such as nodding, shaking its head, and waving its hands,\r\n\r\ntriggered automatically by the interaction content. With the provision of nonverbal\r\n\r\ncues, it is expected that the animated embodiment of the CSR will significantly in-\r\nfluence the initial formation of buyer-seller interpersonal trust.\r\n\r\nH3a: Live help interfaces with a 3D avatar will generate a higher level of cog-\r\nnitive trust in the CSR than interfaces without an avatar.\r\n\r\nH3b: Live help interfaces with a 3D avatar will generate a higher level of\r\nemotional trust in the CSR than interfaces without an avatar.\r\nIn summary, by extending the notion of interpersonal trust from traditional\r\ncommerce to the context of live help in electronic commerce, it is expected that the\r\nhuman-computer interaction interface can be a significant factor in cultivating both\r\ncognitive and emotional trust between consumers and CSRs, which will ultimately\r\ndetermine perceptions of the service quality offered by online vendors.\r\n3. RESEARCH METHODS\r\n3.1. Web Site Design\r\nFor the experiment section of this study,a3×2 factorial design was used, with\r\nthree levels for the use of voice technology and two for the use of avatars. The three\r\npossible conditions regarding TTS voice were the use of text only, the use of voice\r\nonly, and the use of text and voice together. The avatar, however, was either present\r\nor absent. Six simulated live help interfaces were thus constructed (as displayed in\r\nTable 1) and integrated with a shopping Web site designed to sell digital cameras\r\nand camera accessories. The products (digital cameras, camera memory, and photo\r\nprinters) were suitable for this study because they involved a significant amount of\r\n\r\ntechnical information, and real-time interactions are highly appreciated by custom-\r\ners who have questions about the products before committing to a purchase.\r\n\r\nThe look and feel of the interface was designed to resemble actual online shop-\r\nping Web sites as closely as possible. As illustrated in Figures 1 and 2, on the left\r\n\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 83\r\n\r\nside of the screen, a list of product categories was displayed along with compo-\r\nnents typical to e-commerce Web sites. Hyperlinks for product categories led to\r\n\r\nsubcategories where products are further classified. This hierarchy continued until\r\na specific product page was displayed. Three related products (digital cameras,\r\ncamera memory, and photo printers) were used to ensure that enough interactions\r\n\r\nwould take place between each participant and a serviceperson, because most par-\r\n84 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\nTable 1: Six Types of Live Help Interfaces\r\nCondition “Live Help” Interface Features\r\n1 No avatar & text only\r\n2 No avatar & voice only\r\n3 No avatar & text + voice\r\n4 3D avatar & text only\r\n5 3D avatar & voice only\r\n6 3D avatar & text + voice\r\n\r\nFIGURE 1 Live help inter-\r\nface with text chat only.\r\n\r\nFIGURE 2 Live help inter-\r\nface with both TTS voice and\r\n\r\nan avatar.\r\n\r\nticipants would ask the serviceperson some questions about the compatibility and\r\nspecifications of these products.\r\n3.2. Implementation of Live Help\r\nWith the use of “frame” tags of HTML, the shopping site was integrated with a live\r\nhelp interface that was implemented separately, while still giving the participant\r\nthe illusion that the live help feature was part of the shopping site.\r\nTwo research assistants were recruited for the experiment. One accompanied the\r\n\r\nparticipants and guided them through the entire experiment process; the other re-\r\nmained in a separate room and used a networked computer to play the role of a\r\n\r\nCSR. This CSR assistant had been extensively trained regarding both product\r\n\r\nknowledge pertaining to digital cameras and general customer service skills. Be-\r\nfore the experiment, a Web-based product database with detailed specifications\r\n\r\nand product comparisons was prepared for the assistant to answer queries on the\r\nfly, so that the promptness and correctness of the answers could be ensured.\r\nBlaxxun Contact and its online virtual space were used to generate text chatting\r\nand to implement the 3D avatars (see Figures 1 and 2). Blaxxun Contact is a free VR\r\nmarkup language (VRML) plug-in for designing virtual communities. The Blaxxun\r\nplatform provides several forms of communication that can be easily integrated\r\nwith the experimental Web site. In this study, it was used in every condition for text\r\n\r\nchatting and for viewing and controlling a humanoid 3D avatar. In the without-av-\r\natar condition, participants were presented only two frames: the chat input frame\r\n\r\nand the chat output frame. In the with-avatar condition, an additional VRML frame\r\nwas included in which the participants observed an avatar that represented the\r\nCSR. No other avatars were visible on the computer screen. To ensure consistency,\r\n\r\nthe participants were not able to change any visual settings (such as avatar size, dis-\r\ntance, or view angles), except to edit their chat input.\r\n\r\nBody language is the most important characteristic of a 3D avatar. The Blaxxun\r\n\r\nplatform enables its avatars to exhibit several body movements that make commu-\r\nnication more interactive, including waving their hands, nodding, shaking their\r\n\r\nheads, and frowning. All of these body movements are activated by predefined\r\nkeywords in the chat text, that is, the content of the text chat message. During the\r\nexperiment, only the answers and advice given by the serviceperson could trigger\r\n\r\nthe avatar’s body movement. Commonly used emotion-conveying words (for ex-\r\nample, “Hello,” “Exactly,” and “Thank you”) were selected and matched with spe-\r\ncific avatar body movements. Figure 3 demonstrates the interface that links some\r\n\r\nkeywords with specific avatar body movements and body gestures.\r\n\r\nAT&T Natural Voices was selected as the TTS engine for the current study be-\r\ncause it is attributed with providing “the highest measured naturalness and intelli-\r\ngibility for U.S. English TTS in the world” (AT&T Web site). As a component that is\r\n\r\ncompliant with standard Speech Application Program Interfaces, it can be inte-\r\ngrated with other software to “read” designated texts. However, the Blaxxun plat-\r\nform and the AT&T TTS engine are not compatible with each other; thus, another\r\n\r\npiece of software, AT&T Instant Messenger, was employed to operate in the back-\r\nground, for duplicating message texts and reading them aloud.\r\n\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 85\r\n\r\n3.3. Measures\r\nAccording to Komiak and Benbasat (2004), cognitive trust is defined as a trustor’s\r\n\r\nrational assessment that a trustee will have the ability to fulfill its obligations as un-\r\nderstood by the trustor; emotional trust, in contrast, is defined as a trustor’s feel-\r\nings of security and comfort related to his or her reliance on a trustee. Based on card\r\n\r\nsorting and factor analysis, Komiak and Benbasat developed a comprehensive set\r\nof measurements (all 7-point Likert scale items) for both cognitive trust in a\r\ntrustee’s competence (five items) and emotional trust (five items). These measures\r\n\r\nwere used in the current study with minor adaptation (see Appendix 1 for the com-\r\nplete set of measures).\r\n\r\n3.4. Procedures\r\nSeventy-two participants (38 women and 34 men) were recruited for the experiment\r\n\r\nthrough advertisements placed on a university campus. Participants were, on aver-\r\n86 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\nFIGURE 3 Body gestures of the avatar.\r\n\r\nage, 23 years old, and most of them were university students. Their reward was $10\r\ncash, plus a one-in-ten chance to win a gift certificate valued at 50% of the price of the\r\ncamera that they selected during the experiment (up to $200). The participants were\r\nrandomly assigned to one of six interface groups. During the experiment, they were\r\nasked to buy a digital camera and related accessories as a gift for a friend. Time was\r\n\r\nnotlimited,althoughtheparticipantsgenerallyspentaround40to60minonthepur-\r\nchase process. The experimental procedures were designed as follows:\r\n\r\nTraining: After reading the information sheet about the shopping task, each par-\r\nticipant was trained by a research assistant on using and navigating the Web site in-\r\nterface and on using the live help interface. The participants did not proceed to the\r\n\r\nsecond stage until they understood how to use both interfaces.\r\nMain test: Each participant was then asked to examine and to choose a digital\r\ncamera, camera memory, and a photo printer and encouraged to use the live help\r\n\r\nfunction to interact with the CSR for any questions about the Web site or the prod-\r\nucts. After selecting the product they preferred, the participant was asked to put\r\n\r\nthe product into a shopping cart. A research assistant observed and recorded\r\nwhether the participant used the live help feature. In addition, the interaction log\r\n\r\nbetween the participant and the assistant was saved unobtrusively for further anal-\r\nysis, under the “voice only” condition, and a log file was constructed by combining\r\n\r\nthe records from both Blaxxun Contact and AT&T Instant Messenger interfaces.\r\nQuestionnaire: After completing the shopping task, each participant was asked\r\nto fill out a questionnaire with the measures of both cognitive trust and emotional\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\n4. RESULTS\r\nThe data were checked for integrity and completeness before statistical tests were\r\nperformed. Reliability tests indicated that the Cronbach alpha of both dependent\r\n\r\nvariables were greater than 0.8 (the Cronbach alpha of cognitive trust and emo-\r\ntional trust are 0.92 and 0.88, respectively), suggesting that these measures are reli-\r\nable. A univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted on each de-\r\npendent variable. The descriptive statistics and ANOVA results are listed in Tables\r\n\r\n2 and 3.\r\n\r\nThe ANOVA results revealed only marginal differences among the three infor-\r\nmation presentation modes for both cognitive trust, F(2, 66) = 3.08, p < .055, and\r\n\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 87\r\n\r\nTable 2: Means and Standard Deviations for Cognitive Trust and Emotional Trust for\r\n\r\nEach of Six Live Help Interfaces\r\nWithout Avatar With Avatar\r\nText Voice Text + Voice Text Voice Text + Voice\r\nM SD M SD M SD M SD M SD M SD\r\nCognitive trust 5.42 0.94 5.65 0.83 5.32 1.31 5.10 1.35 6.22 0.56 5.43 0.80\r\nEmotional trust 4.80 1.08 5.40 0.74 4.67 1.06 4.92 1.32 5.52 1.23 4.83 1.32\r\n\r\nemotional trust, F(2, 66) = 2.679, p < .08. A post hoc analysis was conducted to fur-\r\nther examine the difference between “TTS voice only” and “text only” conditions\r\n\r\nas well as between “TTS voice only” and “text + TTS voice” conditions. Because of\r\nthe nature of multiple testing, simple pair-wise comparisons may risk inflating the\r\n\r\nnominal .05 alpha level. In other words, individual p values of the pair-wise com-\r\nparisons should be adjusted to test the actual statistical significance. For this rea-\r\nson, Holm’s procedure1 was selected to calculate the adjusted p because it is uni-\r\nformly more powerful than the Bonferroni procedure and other methods of\r\n\r\nadjustment (Aickin & Gensler, 1996). The results are listed in Table 4.\r\nThe results in Table 4 reveal that a CSR communicating through only TTS voice\r\nwas perceived as significantly more trustworthy, in terms of cognitive trust, than\r\n\r\nthe CSR that used only text (Holm-adjusted p < .02) and marginally more trustwor-\r\nthy in terms of emotional trust (Holm-adjusted p < .07). The CSR in “TTS voice\r\n\r\nonly” condition also was evaluated as more trustworthy than that in the “TTS voice\r\n+ text” condition (Holm-adjusted p < .045 for cognitive trust and Holm-adjusted p\r\n\r\n< .65 for emotional trust). In other words, the experiment participants tended to in-\r\nvest more trust in the CSR’s competence and were more likely to trust the CSR emo-\r\ntionally when the live help was presented with only TTS voice, compared with the\r\n\r\ntextual presentation or a mixture of both. Hypotheses H1a and H2a were com-\r\npletely supported whereas H1b and H2b were only marginally supported.\r\n\r\nNo significant difference was found between the avatar group and the\r\nnonavatar group, F(1, 66) = 0.265, p > .60, for cognitive trust and F(1, 66) = .245, p >\r\n.62 for emotional trust. Therefore, hypotheses H3a and H3b were not supported. In\r\n88 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\n1According to Holm (1979), the Holm’s procedure is accomplished as follows. First, the pi values are\r\nplaced in increasing order. Second, each pi is compared with a/(n – i + 1) for rejection. Third, starting\r\nwith the smallest p value, one continues applying these comparisons until the first nonrejection. The\r\nHolm’s adjusted pi equals to max [(n ≤ j ≤ 1)*pj] or 1, whichever is smaller (1 ≤ j ≤ i).\r\nTable 4: Post-Hoc Analysis of Three Voice Conditions\r\nCognitive Trust Emotional Trust\r\n\r\nComparison\r\n\r\nMean\r\nDifference\r\nPair-Wise\r\np\r\nHolm-Adjusted\r\np\r\nMean\r\nDifference\r\nPair-Wise\r\np\r\nHolm-Adjusted\r\np\r\nVoice versus Text .675 .019 .038 .600 .069 .069\r\nVoice versus Text + Voice .558 .041 .041 .708 .032 .064\r\n\r\nTable 3: ANOVA Results of 3D Avatar and TTS Voice\r\nCognitive Trust Emotional Trust\r\nFpFp\r\nAvatar .265 .608 .245 .622\r\nVoice 3.080 .053 2.679 .076\r\nAvatar * Voice 1.154 .322 .004 .996\r\n\r\naddition, no significant interaction effects were found between the two independ-\r\nent variables, F(2, 66) = 1.154, p > .32 for cognitive trust and F(2, 66) = .004, p > .99 for\r\n\r\nemotional trust.\r\n\r\n5. DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe results demonstrate that TTS voice exerts significant effects on users’ percep-\r\ntions of both their cognitive trust in a CSR’s competence and their emotional\r\n\r\ntrust in the CSRs. Consistent with the findings by Jensen et al. (2000), more im-\r\nmediate forms of communication, like TTS, exhibit a greater impact on the devel-\r\nopment of trust. Despite the fact that TTS voice is sometimes monotonous in\r\n\r\nspeed and lacks variety in its tones, it is already realistic enough to generate sig-\r\nnificant social responses, which has been demonstrated by the results of other re-\r\nsearch efforts (E.-J. Lee et al., 2000; K. Lee & Nass, 2003; Nass & Lee, 2000, 2001).\r\n\r\nIn addition, another hypothesis, that the combination of voice and text may add\r\nextra burdens to users’ cognitive efforts and decrease the perceived social cues\r\nfrom voice, has been confirmed, implying that, in the design of multimodality\r\n\r\ncommunication interfaces, it is critical to consider the potential compatibility is-\r\nsues between various channels.\r\n\r\nNo empirical support was found for assertions about the effects of animated\r\navatars on consumer trust. One apparent explanation may be that people do not\r\ncare what the virtual CSR looks like when they are looking for help; conversely,\r\nthe lack of support could be attributed to the limitations of technology. It appears\r\n\r\nthat currently available Web-based animated embodiments still lack the vivid-\r\nness and interactivity that make a strong peripheral cue to influence users’ judg-\r\nments. In this study, although the 3D avatar could generate basic body language,\r\n\r\nthe lack of facial ex<x>pressions greatly degraded the fidelity and warmness one\r\n\r\nmight perceive in face-to-face communication. Further, the voice and body move-\r\nment of the avatar were not perfectly synchronized with each other. Additional\r\n\r\nstudies need to be conducted to test whether the perception of trust can be signif-\r\nicantly enhanced when a more vivid avatar with facial ex<x>pressions and better\r\n\r\nsynchronization is presented.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that some of the significant results have arisen due to novelty ef-\r\nfects, because none of the participants in the TTS or avatar groups had experienced\r\n\r\nsuch live help interfaces in their past online shopping experiences. Although the\r\nnovelty effects may diminish as participants become more accustomed to live help\r\nfunctionality and its interfaces, the impact of interface factors on the formation of\r\ninitial consumer trust should not be underestimated, especially for those pure-play\r\nonline vendors who cannot establish their initial reputations through\r\nbrick-and-mortar stores or other physical presentations. As shoppers build up their\r\ntrusting beliefs through repeated purchase or interaction experiences, “experience\r\ncredibility” (Tseng & Fogg, 1999) will play a more influential role.\r\nAs the prevalence of broadband connections increases average connection\r\nspeeds, other candidate technologies, such as using real human speech through\r\nOnline Consumer Trust and Live Help Interfaces 89\r\n\r\nVoIP or employing online video images captured by a Web cam, will become more\r\n\r\ntechnologically feasible for Live Help services. Technological advances can pro-\r\nvide a communication medium with higher fidelity; however, the lack of support\r\n\r\nfor multitasking will ensure that TTS voice and 3D avatars remain competitive op-\r\ntions in the near future.\r\n\r\n6. SUMMARY\r\nThis article provides new empirical data for the application of the media richness\r\nand social presence theories, as discussed in Section 2, to Web site interfaces and\r\n\r\nvirtual communication design in online shopping environments. With the empha-\r\nses on both cognitive and emotional aspects of consumer trust, these findings com-\r\nplement the results from a relevant study by Qiu and Benbasat (2004), which found\r\n\r\nthat the presence of TTS voice significantly increases consumers’ perceptions of\r\n\r\nflow (a construct depicting a user’s interaction with a computer as playful and ex-\r\nploratory) and that 3D avatars enhance consumers’ feelings of telepresence (a\r\n\r\nuser’s experience of appearing to be present in a remote environment by means of a\r\n\r\ncommunication medium). As this study demonstrated, building on previous re-\r\nsearch, multimedia and multimodal interface components and communication\r\n\r\nmedia have the potential to exert significant influences on the formation of initial\r\ntrust between online shoppers and distant CSRs.\r\n\r\nThe results from this study provide several important implications for practitio-\r\nners in evaluating and designing live help interface features. As mentioned in a re-\r\nport in The Wall Street Journal (Wingfield, 2002), although consumers generally en-\r\njoy the convenience of online shopping, long-distance purchases made without\r\n\r\nhuman contact still make them cautious before putting things into their shopping\r\n\r\ncarts. When a communication interface is rich in expressiveness and closely emu-\r\nlates real face-to-face interactions, a Web merchant will be able to enhance its per-\r\nceived trustworthiness in the eyes of online consumers. This implies that the extra\r\n\r\ncosts of implementing multimedia technologies are justifiable based on the im-\r\nprovement of the merchant’s reputation and correlated increases in the Web site’s\r\n\r\nconversion rate.2 These results also could be used by Customer Relationship Man-\r\nagement software vendors in designing real-time customer-support tools.\r\n\r\nSeveral limitations should be pointed out. Although the laboratory experiment\r\n\r\ncould maintain strict controls over possible confounding variables, the lack of a real-\r\nistic setting and environment may limit its ecological validity. From an experimental\r\n\r\ndesign point of view, the limited sample size employed in this study could pose a se-\r\nrious threat to the application of these findings, indicating that the full set of differ-\r\nences between treatments may be difficult to identify. Similar previous studies have\r\n\r\ndemonstrated that the magnitude of effects of these technologies is usually either\r\n\r\nlow or medium; therefore, additional data should be gathered in future studies to as-\r\n90 Qiu and Benbasat\r\n\r\n2A conversion rate is a metric defined as the number of visitors who make a purchase directly from\r\nthe Web site as a percentage of total visitors.\r\n\r\ncertain whether statistically significant effects would emerge. In addition, the use of\r\n\r\nstudent participants to some extent limits the external validity and general applica-\r\nbility of the results. Users’ personal traits may have some interaction effects with the\r\n\r\nresults. For example, an individual’s level of extroversion might affect whether he or\r\nshe would like to use the live help function to interact with others during shopping\r\nand the ease with which a feeling of emotional trust is developed.\r\n\r\nIn this study, no evidence has been found that the 3D avatar used could signifi-\r\ncantly enhance consumer trust on either cognitive or emotional dimensions. Some\r\n\r\nresearchers have argued that human-like systems may induce users to form false\r\nmental models of the system and typically too high expectations about the system’s\r\nbehavior in cognitive and emotional aspects (Shneiderman & Maes, 1997; Norman,\r\n1994). Should the avatar be designed with a simple and naturalistic look, or should\r\n\r\nit be made as realistic as possible? What type of avatars would be preferred by us-\r\ners: two-dimensional talking-heads or three-dimensional full bodies? Additional\r\n\r\nexploratory studies should be conducted to investigate users’ responses to various\r\navatar designs.\r\n\r\nAs a potentially generalizable application in studies of human-computer inter-\r\naction and online consumer behavior, the design of live help interfaces has been in-\r\nvestigated in this article. The results of this study build the foundation for answer-\r\ning other important questions: How might mediating variables such as feelings of\r\n\r\ntrust affect users’ purchasing decisions? Does a media-rich live help interface in-\r\ncrease the likelihood that users will make repeated visits in the future? Research\r\n\r\nalong these lines is needed to comprehend the full set of potential benefits of TTS\r\nand avatar interface technologies.');

INTRODUCTION\r\nAutism is a lifelong pervasive developmental disorder affecting\r\nsocial, communication and reasoning skills [1]. Formally, it is\r\nconsidered that autism consists of “triad of impairments”:\r\ni. A social impairment: it is very hard for a person with\r\nautism to relate to and empathize with other people;\r\nii. a communication impairment: understanding and\r\nusing verbal and non-verbal signals is very hard for\r\npersons with autism, displaying behaviour considered\r\nsocially or emotionally inappropriate and\r\niii. a tendency towards rigidity and inflexibility in\r\nthinking, language and behaviour.\r\nPeople with autism have a limited range of imaginative activities\r\nand face difficulties in making sense of the social world [2]. In\r\naddition, they have problems in understanding and using both\r\nverbal and non-verbal communication channels. Finally, autism\r\nis characterized with rigidness in thinking, language and\r\nbehaviour. It is agreed that the common individualities of autism\r\nare abnormal reaction to input stimuli, lack of human\r\nengagement and inability to generalize between environments\r\n[3]. Education is considered as the most proper solution for the\r\nproblem of autism. Early stage education might autistic persons\r\nin coping with the “theory of mind deficit – difficulty in\r\nunderstanding mental states of others and ascribing them to\r\nthemselves or others” [4]. Computers have been considered as a\r\npromising educational aiding for autistic persons. One of the\r\nfirst experiments took place in the early 1960’s. Colby had some\r\n\r\ninitial success in using computers to instill an interest in speech-\r\nrelated sounds and language in mute children with autism [5.].\r\n\r\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\r\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\r\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that\r\ncopies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Nowadays,\r\nwith the advancement of Information and Communication\r\nTechnologies (ICT), computer-aided learning or instruction\r\n(CAL/CAI) is considered as a key method for handling autism\r\ninterventions, particularly for young children.\r\nActing not only as machines (objects) but also as if they were\r\npeople (subjects), computers represent a considerable and\r\nvaluable part of the educational techniques [6]. According to the\r\nliterature, autistic persons, children in particular, enjoy\r\ninteracting with computers since they are experienced as “safe”\r\n[7]. This stems from the theory that computers are not having\r\nthe expectations and judgments that make social interaction\r\nproblematic for autistic persons. Recent literature reveals that\r\ncomputer systems represent a controlled environment with\r\nminimum or no distractions that is crucial in the education\r\nprocess for autistic children [8]. It has been reported that in\r\ninteractions with computers, children with autism can feel\r\ncertain level of control over the environment, which cannot\r\nhappen when interacting with human beings [9]. Moreover, this\r\nfeeling of control is independent of the type of software\r\ninterface and is said to be generic to all interactions with\r\ncomputers.\r\nMost of the software platforms use entertaining content in\r\neducational settings in order to present knowledge in an\r\nattractive way. This synergy is often called “edutainment” [10].\r\nThis paper presents an evaluation of the edutainment platform\r\nfor autistic children – Affective Computer-Aided Learning\r\nPlatform for Children with Autism (ACALPA) [11]. The\r\nplatform supports edutainment method using an affective avatar,\r\nsynthesized speech and multimedia content (videos, images and\r\nsounds). The main goal of the platform is to facilitate the\r\nteacher-child learning scheme where the users will be both the\r\nteachers and the children with autism. Therefore, the evaluation\r\nprocess is primarily focused on the impact of the platform as\r\nseen by the educators. The goal is to evaluate the\r\nimplementation of recent advances in research, theory and\r\ntechnology (affective avatars, speech etc.). Thirteen educators of\r\nautistic people participated in the study. The evaluation included\r\na questionnaire oriented towards to the feedback they received\r\nfrom the autistic people within a one-month period of usage as\r\nan educational tool.\r\n2. RELATED WORK\r\nRecent research and literature reveals that virtual reality systems\r\nand collaborative virtual environments utilizing emotionally\r\nexpressive avatars can facilitate people with autism by means of\r\nan assistive technology, an educational technology or a\r\ntherapeutic technology [12]. Avatars express their mental and\r\nemotional state especially via facial ex<x>pressions. Recent research\r\nintroduces that because these avatars’ emotions are highly\r\ndistinctive and easily recognizable people with autism appear to\r\nunderstand and to use them appropriately [13]. Moreover,\r\nfindings in psychology and neurology suggest that emotions are\r\nalso an important factor in decision-making, problem solving,\r\ncognition and intelligence in general. [13]. Picard signalized that\r\nthe emotional state of others affects not only our own emotional\r\nstate, but directly the decisions we make [14]. Another area\r\nwhere emotions are used is that of learning. It has been argued\r\n\r\nthat the ability to show emotions through body language ensures\r\nthe quality of tutor-learner and learner-learner interaction [15].\r\nFurthermore, most of the educational platforms that have been\r\ndeveloped in order to satisfy the educators and the persons with\r\nautism focus on their unique learning styles. Current literature\r\nindicates that there is a high level of use of special education\r\nsoftware [16] However, teachers working with young learners\r\nwho are autistic, report significant shortcomings with a large\r\nnumber of software platforms in use in their classrooms.\r\nDifficulties that have come to light include insufficient error\r\ncontrol, inappropriate audio feedback on error, and other user\r\nproblems [16].\r\nTherefore, although software design remains poorly\r\ndocumented, several experimental studies have shown the\r\nusefulness of computers for autism [17]. Psychopathologists\r\nexpress growing interest in using computers for special\r\neducation of autistic people [18]. Besides that, parents were\r\namong the first to develop computer-based approaches for this\r\npurpose [19].\r\n3. THE SYSTEM\r\nACALPA is a platform that is intended to enhance or mediate\r\nthe teacher-child educational process [11]. It is based on various\r\ninteraction procedures according to the disability level of the\r\nautistic person in question. Several modules comprise the\r\nplatform. Each of them represents a specific learning domain.\r\nNamely, there are modules where the child is asked to identify\r\nthe correct image between two or more images, to put images in\r\nthe correct sequence (according to time), identify emotions by\r\nvisual ex<x>pressions etc. Furthermore, the more complex modules\r\nare in the form of semi-virtual environments. They provide the\r\nchild with the ability to interact in a safe and controlled way.\r\nThe theme of each module varies from objects in the normal\r\nsurroundings, everyday use objects, colours, words etc. The\r\ninstructions are given either by an affective avatar, synthesized\r\nspeech in autistic person’s native language (in the specific\r\nexample - Greek), written in the screen, by the corresponding\r\nmakaton symbol or a combination of these. Additionally, the\r\navatar can express emotions depending on the situations, e.g.\r\nhappiness when the correct image is selected, sadness if not. The\r\ninstructions and the difficulty level can be personalised for each\r\nuser. User input/feedback is facilitated by means of a mouse\r\ninteraction, a touch screen or large buttons attached to the\r\ncomputer.\r\nEqually important function of the platform is the recording of\r\nthe interaction/education process in a database. Consequently,\r\nthe educators are enabled with track record of the users’\r\nprogress and modify the difficulty levels accordingly.\r\nAdditionally, an educator may register specific educational or\r\npersonality data for each autistic person. The printable format of\r\nall the records (Fig. 1) enables easy monitoring and analysis of\r\nthe learning process. In this way, a longitudinal record may be\r\nachieved indicating “a learning curve” for each autistic person\r\nseparately, thereby enhancing and normalising the educational\r\nprocedures toward each person’s needs.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 Printable report representing percent of success and\r\ntime of completion of each instance.\r\n4. EVALUATION OF THE SYSTEM\r\nThe system was implemented in a specialised school for people\r\nwith autism. The school numbers approximately 50 persons with\r\nautism, ranging from 8 to 30 years of age, but mostly children.\r\nThe persons are educated by thirteen highly specialised\r\neducators. The system was used for a period of one month as\r\npart of the daily educational process. Furthermore, at least one\r\neducator was accompanying a child in the interaction with the\r\nsystem. Meanwhile, children’s progress was tracked through the\r\nreports of the system.\r\nAt the end of the usage period, the teachers were given a\r\nquestionnaire that inspects the main aspects of the platform and\r\nthe edutainment process using the platform. The questionnaire\r\nconsists of the categories shown in Table 1.\r\nTable 1. Contents of the Questionnaire\r\nCategory Type of questions\r\nContent\r\n\r\nRelated to autistic persons daily life, non-\r\ndiscriminating, integration of the content,\r\n\r\nability to add more.\r\n\r\nEducational\r\nApproach Of\r\nTheory\r\n\r\nAccording to the theories for educating\r\nautistic persons, ability to support\r\ntechniques and methods used in this kind\r\nof education (TEACCH), autonomic\r\neducation or working as a team.\r\n\r\nEducational\r\nApproach In\r\nPractice\r\n\r\nSupporting of creativity, attract the\r\nattention of autistic persons, supporting\r\nof skill and difficulty levels, educational\r\nmaterial well organized\r\n\r\nTechnological\r\nPerformance\r\n\r\nProtection of sensitive data, printable\r\nforms and reports\r\nInteraction Can educator provide a new approach of\r\nthe educational procedure, avatar and\r\n\r\nsynthesized speech interaction, emotional\r\nface of the avatar, multimedia material.\r\n\r\nFeedback\r\n\r\nFeedback provide by the system to the\r\nuser under question, positive and negative\r\n\r\nfeedback\r\n\r\nSoftware Design\r\n\r\nClear and simple design, complexity, use\r\nof colors and fonts, navigation through\r\n\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 Persons with autism most of the times are able to\r\nrecognize the avatar’s emotional state\r\nEvaluation of the results on our survey indicates that the avatar\r\nadvances the educational process (Fig. 3). Educators suggest\r\nthat most of the times persons with autism are able to recognize\r\nthe avatar’s mental and emotional state provided by facial\r\nex<x>pressions (Fig. 2). Moreover the synthesized speech is\r\nprovided by lips synchronisation of the avatar. Consequently, an\r\navatar speaking in the native language of the autistic persons is\r\nmaking more sense than an avatar without speech. Educators\r\nbelieve that an avatar with native voice is more effective than an\r\navatar without voice (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\nFig. 3 Evaluation of the avatar’s usefulness in the educational\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nAn interesting point which characterized children with autism is\r\nthat they are unable to choose which event is more or less\r\nimportant [20]. As a consequence they are often saturated\r\nbecause of too many stimuli and thus they adopt an extremely\r\nrepetitive, unusual, self-injurious, or aggressive behaviour.\r\nDuring development of the system, educators ask for the\r\nsoftware not to be complex. For instance, if a child should\r\ndistinguish a dog from a cat, the multimedia material should\r\ndepict only the dog and the cat, without extra background\r\ninformation. For this reason the multimedia material is as simple\r\nas possible by providing clearly the main objects. By this way,\r\nthe system helps children with autism to focus their attention on\r\na specific task. On the other hand, educators have the ability to\r\nexperiment by providing inchmeal more complex themes.\r\nEvaluation of the results indicates that although most of the\r\ntimes the multimedia material attracts autistic persons only in\r\nsome of them the autistic persons are not complicated (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\nFig. 4 The content presented by the system appears to be\r\nattractive and not complex for autistic people.\r\nMoreover, one of the goals of our investigation was to examine\r\nif the system is able to support techniques and methods that are\r\nused in autistic persons’ education. For example, the TEACCH\r\nintervention program (Treatment and Education of Autistic and\r\nrelated Communication handicapped CHildren) involves a\r\nstructured teaching approach and the use of visual materials.\r\nTEACCH is providing services for autistic people by making\r\nuse of various associated techniques depending upon the\r\nindividual person\'s needs [21]. TEACCH principles involve\r\nchanging the behaviour and skill level of the person as well as\r\ndeveloping an environment that matches the person’s needs.\r\nTEACCH is a structured technique especially targeting to the\r\nperson’s visual processing strengths by organizing the\r\nenvironment and providing a visual conduct to supply\r\ninformation about activities. Visual structure is provided at a\r\nvariety of levels such as organizing areas of the environment,\r\nproviding a daily schedule using pictures or written words, as\r\nwell as visual instructions and visual organization signalling the\r\nbeginning and end of tasks. This technique is based upon the\r\nobservation that children with autism learn and connect\r\ninformation differently than other children. Accepting this\r\nmethod’s principles while developing the system, the educators\r\nwere asked for a feedback about the system’s ability to support\r\nmethods used in education of autistic persons. Most of the\r\n\r\neducators agreed that the structure and the content of the system\r\nare formed in the right way so as to make it capable of\r\nsupporting the TEACCH method (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\nFig. 5 Most of the educators agree that the system is capable\r\nof supporting the TEACCH method.\r\nDuring the initial stage of the system development, interviews\r\nwith educators of autistic persons revealed that the feedback\r\nprovided to the autistic persons during educational process plays\r\nan essential role. Based on this, the system approach on a\r\nsuccessful answer is integrated by means of the avatar’s happy\r\nemotion, a voice telling “Bravo” or “Well done” and sound of\r\napplause. On the contrary, the avatar, with a sad face,\r\nencourages the user to try again. Not only has the type of the\r\nfeedback but also the timing played essential role in keeping the\r\npersons attention. Moreover, in both occasions, the avatar uses\r\nthe autistic person’s name; an ability that stems from the\r\npersonalized system’s architecture. On our survey, most of the\r\neducators showed a positive impact on the feedback that is\r\nprovided by our system. Most of them agreed that the feedback\r\nis suited in the appropriate form, although it should be more\r\nhelpful in case of a wrong answer. As a result, the feedback\r\napproach we followed appears to suit the needs of the user with\r\nautism (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nFig. 6 The feedback of the avatar provided in the right way\r\n\r\nAs described in the introduction of this paper, mush recent\r\neducational research focuses on teaching and learning by means\r\nof the usage of personal computers. According to the current\r\nliterature, persons with autism enjoy interacting with computers.\r\nThis stems from the lack of expectations and judgments by the\r\npersonal computer. This “safe” environment acts as a catalyst in\r\nthe educational process. Bernard-Optiz et al. [22] studied\r\ntraining procedures with software used for social behavior\r\neducation. The study carried out in two different groups of\r\nchildren: a group of children with autism and a group of\r\nchildren without autism. Children had to find a solution to\r\ndifferent scenarios involving characters in problematic social\r\nconflicts. While the performances of both groups improved, the\r\nprogression of the group without autism was steadier.\r\nResults suggested that autistic persons are more interested in\r\nusing a personal computer (independently of the software) rather\r\nthan playing with other kind of games or toys.\r\n\r\nFig. 7 Persons with autism are more interested in interacting\r\nwith a personal computer rather than playing with other\r\ntypes of games or toys.\r\nIn our try to evaluate our software (ACALPA) as for the variety,\r\nthe quality and the impact to the user’s mental state, related\r\ngroups of questions were included to the questionnaire.\r\nEducators believe that the variety and the quality of the content\r\nthat is represented by the software are able to support the\r\neducational approach we followed. Moreover, the evaluation of\r\nthe results on our survey indicates that in most of the cases the\r\nsystem encourages the autistic person (Fig. 8). A more\r\ninteresting finding is the persuasion of the educators that the\r\nsystem is able not only to provide but also to motivate social\r\nactivities among the autistic persons and collaboration in term of\r\ngroups. In addition, the level of creativity is increasing in most\r\nof the cases\r\n\r\nFig. 8 Educators believe that the system suits the educational\r\nneeds\r\n5. CONCLUSION\r\nThis study demonstrates that an interactive learning environment\r\nmight facilitate the educational procedure for people with\r\nautism.\r\nThirteen educators of autistic persons used our platform\r\n(ACALPA) for a month. The questionnaire provided by them\r\nreveals that using of avatars in such system is promising for\r\npeople with autism. Moreover, avatar’s emotional ex<x>pressions,\r\nprovided in a safe environment, makes autistic persons\r\nunderstand the emotional state more easily. Furthermore,\r\neducators believe that when the avatar is accompanied by a\r\nsynthesized speech in the autistic’s native language the\r\neducational processes are facilitated in a more proper way.\r\nIn addition, the multimedia content plays essential role in the\r\nprocedure. Based on the results, content must be not only\r\nattractive but also simple in order not to complicate the persons\r\nwith autism. Moreover, it should contain content from variety\r\nactivities of the daily life. In this way, autistic persons don’t lose\r\ntheir interest during the game.\r\nAnother point is that supporting of techniques and methods that\r\nare used in autistic persons’ education, such as TEACCH, gives\r\nthe ability to the educators to integrate a large amount of\r\ninformation in a more organized way.\r\nFinally, the appropriate feedback of the software during the\r\ninteraction with the autistic person is very important. Our system\r\nprovides the appropriate feedback, in the appropriate time by a\r\nhelpful form. The feedback is provided by means of the avatar,\r\nthe synthesized speech, text, makaton symbol, sound or\r\ncombination of them.\r\nFurther work includes usage or designing of different type of\r\napplications in order to capture autistic person’s movements as a\r\nfactor of their behaviour [23]. Automated capture technologies\r\nand the associated access interfaces for exploring past\r\nexperiences are particularly promising for monitoring the\r\neffectiveness educational systems for behavioural and learning\r\ndisabilities in children [24].\r\n\r\n6.

Here Erin is giving a lecture on geographical locations\r\nof ancient China.\r\nthese attributes in social interactions might enable designers\r\nto create more effective virtual agents in these domains.\r\nGaze cues are an important subset of the embodied cues that\r\npeople employ in social interactions. Using gaze cues, people\r\ncan control the flow of a conversation, indicate interest in or\r\n\r\nappraisal of objects and people, improve listeners’ comprehen-\r\nsion, express complex emotions, and facilitate interpersonal\r\n\r\nprocesses [1, 3, 36]. In order to design virtual agents that\r\n\r\nachieve such significant effects, we must first design mecha-\r\nnisms that capture key variables of gaze and generate appropri-\r\nate gaze behaviors. However, creating effective gaze cues for\r\n\r\nvirtual characters is an open challenge, as humans have built\r\nand finessed subtle but complex patterns in which they use\r\nthese cues over thousands of years of evolution and developed\r\na sensitivity to observing them in others [42]. Furthermore,\r\nhow these design variables might be varied to achieve specific\r\n\r\nhigh-level social and cognitive outcomes is not well under-\r\nstood. The goal of our research is to explore how agents\r\n\r\nmight achieve these outcomes through subtle variations in\r\ngaze behaviors and what design variables might enable such\r\nvariations. We contextualize the work presented in this paper\r\nin an educational scenario, in which virtual agents promise\r\nimprovements in affiliation with students and in learning.\r\nIn this paper, we demonstrate that virtual agents can use subtle\r\nvariations in gaze to achieve significant high-level outcomes.\r\nWe present a parametric model that synthesizes appropriate\r\ngaze behaviors and allows for systematic variations in these\r\nbehaviors, which we validated through an online user study\r\nwith 96 participants. Our design of the gaze model draws\r\non research in human physiology, which precisely describes\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 705\r\n\r\nhow humans coordinate various gaze parameters such as the\r\nmovements of the eyes and the head when executing gaze\r\nshifts—the intentional redirection of gaze toward a particular\r\npiece of information in the context of interaction. Gaze shifts\r\nare a fundamental building block of overall gaze behavior.\r\nThrough subtle variation in timing and movement of the head\r\nand eyes, individuals construct a range of high-level behaviors.\r\nOur model of gaze was designed and parameterized in such\r\na way as to provide sufficient control over the subtleties of\r\nhead and eye movements, enabling a virtual agent to naturally\r\ndisplay these behaviors.\r\nWe also present a user study with 20 participants, in which we\r\ninvestigated how a virtual agent (Figure 1) might manipulate\r\nlow-level gaze parameters to achieve high-level effects such\r\nas improved learning and feelings of rapport in a storytelling\r\ncontext. We manipulated the parameters of our gaze model\r\n\r\nto create affiliative gaze—maintaining a head orientation to-\r\nward the participant to emphasize the social interaction [12]—\r\n\r\nand referential gaze—maintaining a head orientation toward\r\nshared visual space to emphasize the information to which\r\nthe speaker is referring [30]. In both cases, the agent looks\r\nat the same targets; the difference lies in the timing and the\r\ndegree to which the agent uses its head or eyes to look at these\r\ntargets. The results showed that these manipulations generated\r\nsignificant social and cognitive effects; the use of affiliative\r\ngaze improved the perceptions of the agent and the use of\r\nreferential gaze increased recall performance.\r\nThe remainder of the paper provides related work on gaze\r\nfrom a number of perspectives, describes our model and a\r\nvalidation study, outlines the design and results of our user\r\nstudy, and discusses our findings and their implications for the\r\ndesign of effective gaze mechanisms for virtual agents.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nGaze is an important social cue that has been studied under\r\na number of different academic disciplines. First we present\r\n\r\nwork in psychology on how humans use their gaze in social in-\r\nteractions, as well as some of the achievable high-level effects\r\n\r\nof gaze. Next we discuss related work on embodied conversa-\r\ntional agents in the computer graphics and HCI literatures.\r\n\r\nGaze in Human Communication\r\nIn general, being gazed at by another person can result in a\r\n\r\nnumber of interesting effects. Gaze is predominantly inter-\r\npreted as being attended to, and depending on the context of\r\n\r\ninteraction, being gazed at can lead to discomfort from feeling\r\nobserved, or lead to genuine social interaction [1]. A person\r\nwho makes increased eye contact is associated with greater\r\nperceived dynamism, likeability, and believability [4]. These\r\n\r\npeople are also seen as more truthful or credible [1]. One illus-\r\ntrative study specifically showed that people who spend more\r\n\r\ntime gazing at an interviewer receive higher socioemotional\r\nevaluations [16]. On the other hand, gaze aversion produces\r\n\r\nconsistently negative effects in impressions of attraction, cred-\r\nibility, and relational communication [5].\r\n\r\nAn important construct in the study of nonverbal behavior\r\nis immediacy, defined as the degree of perceived physical or\r\npsychological closeness between people [37]. Gaze has been\r\n\r\nfound to be a significant component of immediacy, especially\r\n\r\nin the context of improving educational outcomes [21]. Stu-\r\ndents from primary school age through college have been\r\n\r\nshown to learn better when they are gazed at by the lecturer\r\n[41, 47]. Learning in these cases was usually measured by\r\nthe students’ performance on recall tasks. In a similar study,\r\ngazing into the camera during a video link conversation was\r\nshown to increase the recall of the viewer at the other end [14].\r\nGaze’s positive effect on recall is usually attributed to its role\r\nas an arousal stimulus, which increases attentional focus and\r\ntherefore enhances memory [26].\r\nThe above work shows that gaze as a whole can create positive\r\ninteractions and learning effects. Our goal is to investigate how\r\nsubtle parameters of gaze might serve to strengthen or weaken\r\nthese effects. One of these parameters is the alignment of\r\nthe head, which plays a substantial role in shifting a viewer’s\r\nvisual attention [23]. Gazing at someone with the head fully\r\naligned (affiliative gaze) might be perceived differently than\r\ngazing at someone out of the corner of the eyes with the\r\nhead aligned towards information of interest in the context of\r\ninteraction (referential gaze). A virtual agent might be able to\r\nmanipulate this, and other parameters, to achieve specifically\r\ndesired effects.\r\nEmbodied Conversational Agents\r\n\r\nOur work builds on previous research in the area of embod-\r\nied conversational agents. Developing embodied agents that\r\n\r\ncan communicate effectively is a significant area of research.\r\nGiving these agents more complex and human-like behaviors\r\n\r\nhas been a longstanding goal, for example to make inhab-\r\nited interfaces and agents in VR environments more effective\r\n\r\n[40]. The ability to use non-verbal communicative behavior is\r\nvery important as it increases positive feelings of copresence\r\nand familiarity, and in general makes agents more effective\r\ncommunicators [2].\r\nAn agent’s gaze behavior is very important to providing rich\r\ninteractions; well-designed gaze mechanisms–e.g., gazing at\r\nturn-taking boundaries during conversation–can result in more\r\n\r\nefficient task performance and more positive subjective evalu-\r\nations [22]. However, poor gaze behavior can be worse than\r\n\r\nno gaze at all. The positive effects of having an embodied\r\nagent–as opposed to only audio or text–can be completely\r\n\r\nlost if the gaze is very poor or random [15]. Gaze behav-\r\nior of a female virtual agent, when coupled with the agent’s\r\n\r\nappearance, can make the difference between enhancing nega-\r\ntive attitudes toward women or breaking gender stereotypes\r\n\r\n[10]. The high-level effects of gaze discussed above have been\r\nshown to also extend to physical embodiments, such as robots.\r\nFor example, the learning effect of gaze has been observed in\r\nhuman-robot interactions; increased gaze from a storytelling\r\nrobot facilitates greater recall of the story [39].\r\nPrevious work on modeling human gaze to inform the design\r\n\r\nof agents includes the area of turn management [8, 43], figur-\r\ning out where agents should be looking and why they should be\r\n\r\nlooking there [25, 31], or how an agent should make random\r\n\r\neye saccades in idle situations [6] or face-to-face conversa-\r\ntions [32]. Some attempts have been made to model head and\r\n\r\neye motions for virtual agent gaze, including data-driven [9]\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 706\r\n\r\nTarget, Agent,\r\n& Environmental\r\nParameters\r\nHead Latency\r\nParameter\r\n\r\nOMR Head Alignment\r\nPreferences\r\n\r\nVelocity\r\nProles\r\n\r\nHead Movement\r\nEye Movement\r\nKey Input\r\nParameters\r\n\r\nKey Stages of\r\nGaze Shi\r\n\r\nEnd\r\nLatency Period\r\n\r\nEyes Reach\r\nTarget + Start VOR\r\n\r\ntime\r\n\r\nMove Head to Target if (–) Move Head to Target Move Head to Target\r\nMove Eyes to Target if (+) Move Eyes to Target Eyes Engage in VOR\r\n\r\nGaze Shi\r\nComplete\r\n\r\nGaze Shi\r\nStart\r\nB D E\r\n\r\nF\r\n\r\nC\r\n\r\nHead Latency Negative\r\nHead Latency Positive\r\nA\r\n\r\nFigure 2.

In general, existing research has proven that\r\nmore realistic gaze behavior for humanoid avatars results in\r\nconsiderably improved and fluid communication [15]. At the\r\nvery least, simply conveying gaze direction eases turntaking\r\nand is essential to establishing who is talking and listening to\r\nwhom in multiparty mediated communication [50].\r\nWhile previous research has explored how gross manipulations\r\nin gaze behavior might shape user experience and perceptions\r\nof virtual characters, how specific parameters in the control\r\n\r\nspace for gaze might be mapped to specific outcomes in in-\r\nteraction has not been explored. Our work seeks to fill this\r\n\r\nknowledge gap. Our model of gaze, presented next, provides\r\nparameters that work as low-level gaze variables, and allows\r\n\r\nus to investigate their impact on high-level outcomes in a prin-\r\ncipled way. Advantages of our model include its procedural\r\n\r\nsimplicity, grounded nature, and proven ability to produce\r\nlarge objective and subjective high-level effects through the\r\nmanipulation of very subtle parameters.\r\nDESIGNING EFFECTIVE GAZE MECHANISMS\r\nIn order to design virtual agents to be effective communicators,\r\nwe must develop a deeper understanding of how humans use\r\nsubtle gaze behavior to achieve high-level outcomes. We turn\r\nto research in neurophysiology to develop this understanding.\r\n\r\nNeurophysiologists have studied how humans and other pri-\r\nmates coordinate head and eye movements during gaze shifts,\r\n\r\nin the process revealing potential parameters of gaze that might\r\n\r\neventually lead to the positive social outcomes we wish to cre-\r\nate with virtual agents. Here we present the most relevant\r\n\r\nfindings from neurophysiology literature which we combine\r\ninto a model of gaze shifts useful to virtual agents. We also\r\npresent a validation of our model, taking the form of a user\r\nstudy, which shows that virtual agents using the model can\r\nexecute gaze shifts that are both communicative and natural. 1\r\n\r\nGiven the current configuration of the head and eyes and in-\r\nput parameters indicating movement characteristics and tar-\r\nget gaze direction, our model computes a trajectory for the\r\n\r\n1A full specification of the model, including documented pseudocode,\r\nfull details of the validation, and videos of animated characters using\r\nthe model for their own gaze behavior, can be found at http://hci.cs.\r\nwisc.edu/projects/gaze.\r\n\r\nhead and eyes. It first computes a few key variables for the\r\nmovement, and then computes velocities for the head and eye\r\nrotations for each frame of the animated movement, keeping\r\nthe gaze on target until the eyes and head have reached their\r\nfinal target rotations. The model is presented graphically in\r\nFigure 2, and includes six main components: (A) target, agent,\r\n\r\nand environmental parameters, (B) head latency, (C) veloc-\r\nity profiles for head and eye motion, (D) oculomotor range\r\n\r\n(OMR) specifications, (E) head alignment preferences, and (F)\r\nthe vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR).\r\nThe first variable to compute when executing a gaze shift is\r\nhead movement latency in relationship to the eye movement\r\n\r\n(Figure 2b). This head latency can vary from person to per-\r\nson and task to task. Factors such as target amplitude, the\r\n\r\npredictability of the target [44], modality of the target (visual\r\nor auditory) [17, 18], target saliency, vigilance of the subject,\r\nand whether the gaze shift is forced or natural [51] have an\r\n\r\neffect. These factors serve as the target, agent, and environ-\r\nmental input parameters to our model (Figure 2a). Our model\r\n\r\nstochastically combines these parameters to determine the\r\nhead latency based on findings from Zangemeister et al. [51].\r\nA positive latency results in a period of eye motion during\r\nwhich the head remains fixed, while a negative latency result\r\nin a period of head motion while the eyes remain fixed.\r\nOnce the head latency period is complete, both the eyes and\r\nhead begin simultaneously moving towards the target. Both\r\nduring and after the latency period, each eye and the head\r\nfollow velocity profiles (Figure 2c) that resemble standard\r\nease-in and ease-out functions [27, 32]. These movements\r\nprevent unnatural head motions caused by high-frequency\r\nsignals [35]. The maximum velocity of the eyes and head—\r\nthe peaks of the velocity profiles—are computed based on\r\npositive linear relationships with the amplitude of the intended\r\ngaze shift [20]. Once the maximum velocity for the gaze shift\r\nis computed, the shift is executed by computing the actual\r\nvelocity for each frame of the animation. The velocity is\r\ndetermined by a piecewise polynomial function derived to\r\napproximate the published experimental data. This polynomial\r\nfunction can be expressed as follows, where g is the proportion\r\nof the gaze shift completed, Vmax is the maximum velocity,\r\nand V is the current calculated velocity.\r\n\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 707\r\n\r\nV =\r\n\r\n2Vmax · g g ∈ [0, 0.5)\r\n4Vmax · g\r\n2 − 8Vmax · g + 4Vmax g ∈ [0.5, 1]\r\nAn important component of the model is the oculomotor range\r\n(OMR) (Figure 2d), which limits rotation of the eyes such that\r\nthey don’t roll back into the head. The human OMR has been\r\nestimated to be between 45◦\r\nand 55◦\r\n. A virtual character’s\r\nbaseline OMR can be determined based on the size of the\r\neye cavities and the size of its pupils and irises. However,\r\nmerely encoding these OMR values as static parameters is\r\nnot sufficient, as the effective OMR may fluctuate during the\r\ncourse of a single gaze shift. The fluctuation is a product of\r\nthe neural (as opposed to mechanical) nature of the limitation\r\nimposed on eye motion. The virtual agent’s eye rotations are\r\nnever allowed to surpass the current effective OMR.\r\nAt the onset of a gaze shift, effective OMR is computed based\r\non the initial eye position and the baseline OMR. Initial eye\r\n\r\nposition is measured in degrees as a rotational offset of the cur-\r\nrent eye orientation from a central (in-head) orientation. This\r\n\r\nvalue is only non-zero when the rotational offset is contralat-\r\neral (on the opposite side of center) to the target. When the\r\n\r\neyes begin the gaze shift at these angles, the effective OMR\r\nhas a value close to the original baseline value. When the\r\neyes begin the gaze shift closer to a central orientation in the\r\nhead, the effective OMR diminishes [11]. Effective OMR\r\nis also updated throughout the gaze shift at every time step\r\naccording to the concurrent head velocity. As the head moves\r\nfaster, the effective OMR diminishes [20]. See the online\r\nsupplement for details on the effective OMR computations,\r\nincluding equations and empirically derived constants.\r\nThe next component of the model is a user-defined parameter\r\n\r\nspecifying the head alignment preferences of the agent (Fig-\r\nure 2e). Head alignment—how much individuals use their\r\n\r\nheads in performing a gaze shift—is highly idiosyncratic, and\r\ncreates a differential directness of gaze at the target [13]. A\r\nparameter value of 0% for head alignment indicates that once\r\nthe eyes have reached the gaze target, the head stops moving,\r\nresulting in gaze at the target out of the corner of the eyes. On\r\nthe other hand, at a 100% parameter value for head alignment,\r\nthe head continues rotating until it is completely aligned with\r\nthe target, with concomitant compensatory eye movement to\r\nkeep the eyes directed toward the target, resulting in gaze\r\nwith the eyes and head both fully directed towards the target.\r\nHead alignment values between these two extremes can be\r\ncomputed using spherical linear interpolation between the two\r\n\r\ncorresponding rotational values. This parameter can be manip-\r\nulated to create affiliative gaze–keeping high head alignment\r\n\r\nwith a conversational partner and low head alignment with\r\n\r\neverything else–or referential gaze–keeping high head align-\r\nment with information being referred to in the environment\r\n\r\nand low head alignment with the conversational partner. Head\r\nalignment is the most directly controllable input parameter to\r\nthe model, and as such is the parameter we focus on in our\r\nexperimental methodology.\r\nOnce the eyes have reached their target, the vestibulo-ocular\r\nreflex (VOR) keeps them locked to the target while the head\r\n\r\nfinishes its rotation (Figure 2f). This component of gaze,\r\nthe final in our model, is handled by rotating the eyes in the\r\nopposite direction of head motion as the head completes its\r\nportion of the gaze shift, keeping the eyes fixated on the gaze\r\ntarget even as the head keeps rotating.\r\nAncillary components of our model include a blink controller\r\n\r\nfor generating both random and gaze-evoked blinking as de-\r\nscribed by Peters [45], and idle gaze behavior. When the agent\r\n\r\nis not actively engaging in a gaze shift following our model,\r\nthe eyes are controlled by an implementation of the model\r\npresented in Lee et al. [32]. This implementation of subtle\r\n\r\nrandom eye movements has been shown to dramatically in-\r\ncrease the realism of the character. The virtual character’s\r\n\r\neyelids also move with vertical shifts of the eyes, rising up as\r\nthe eyes pitch upwards and dropping down as the eyes pitch\r\ndownward [48]. Lastly, we implemented ambient facial and\r\nbodily cues for our virtual characters to prevent the unnatural\r\nrigidity inherent to a static character. When the character is in\r\nan idle state, these cues include smiles and slight movements\r\nof the arms and the head.\r\nModel Validation\r\n\r\nOur model development was followed by an empirical evalua-\r\ntion of the communicative accuracy and perceived naturalness\r\n\r\nof gaze shifts generated by our model. We compared gaze\r\nshifts generated by our model against those generated by a\r\nbaseline model and those displayed by a human.\r\n\r\nParticipants – Ninety-six participants (50 males and 46 fe-\r\nmales) took part in the validation study. The participants were\r\n\r\nrecruited through Amazon.com’s Mechanical Turk online mar-\r\nketplace, following crowd-sourcing best practices to minimize\r\n\r\nthe risk of abuse and to achieve a wide range of demographic\r\nrepresentation [28, 24]. Participants received $2.50.\r\nStudy Design – In the study, participants were shown a series\r\nof videos in which either an animated virtual character or a\r\nhuman confederate shifted gaze toward one of sixteen objects\r\narranged on a desk. This simplified scenario allowed us to\r\nfocus our evaluation on the effectiveness and naturalness of\r\ngaze shifts, while minimizing contextual and interactional\r\nMale Human Confederate Female Human Confederate\r\n\r\nAgent with Male Appearance Agent with Female Appearance\r\nFigure 3.

Participants observed the agent from the\r\nperspective of a collaborator seated across from the agent\r\nor the human confederate. The objects on the desk were\r\nseparated into four groups, distinguished by color and shape.\r\nStill images from the videos are shown in Figure 3.\r\nThe study followed a two-by-four split-plot design. The factors\r\nwere gender–participant matched with agent–varying between\r\nparticipants, and model type, varying within participants. The\r\n\r\nmodel type independent variable included gaze shifts gener-\r\nated by a baseline gaze model from Peters [45], and those\r\n\r\nproduced by our model. The model type independent vari-\r\nable also included two control conditions. In the first control\r\n\r\ncondition, a virtual agent with a male or female appearance\r\n\r\nmaintained gaze toward the participant (i.e., the camera) with-\r\nout producing any gaze shifts at all. In the second control\r\n\r\ncondition, a male or female human confederate presented gaze\r\n\r\nshifts toward the object on a desk in front of him/her. The or-\r\nder in which the conditions were presented to each participant\r\n\r\nwas counterbalanced.\r\nProcedure – Each participant was shown 32 videos of a virtual\r\n\r\ncharacter or human. In the videos, the agents or the confeder-\r\nates gazed toward the participant (i.e., the camera), announced\r\n\r\nthat they are about to look toward an object of a specific color\r\non the table, shifted their gaze toward the object, and moved\r\ntheir gaze back toward the participant. Following each video,\r\nthe participants answered a set of questions that measured the\r\ndependent variables. Participants evaluated each condition\r\nfour times in a stratified order. Each video was approximately\r\n10 seconds, with the overall study lasting around 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nMeasures – The validation study used two dependent vari-\r\nables: communicative accuracy and perceived naturalness.\r\n\r\nCommunicative accuracy was measured by capturing whether\r\nparticipants correctly identified the object toward which the\r\ngaze shift of the agent was directed. Perceived naturalness\r\n\r\nwas measured with a four-item scale with high reliability, in-\r\ncluding naturalness, humanlikeness, lifelikeness, and realism,\r\n\r\nCronbach’s α = .94.\r\nResults – We conducted a mixed-model analysis of variance\r\n(ANOVA) on the data to determine the effect that different\r\n\r\nCommunicative Accuracy\r\nAgent Human Our\r\nModel\r\nBaseline\r\nModel\r\np = ns\r\np = ns\r\n\r\n10%\r\n0%\r\n20%\r\n30%\r\n40%\r\n50%\r\n60%\r\n70%\r\n80%\r\n90%\r\n100%\r\n\r\nPerceived Naturalness\r\n\r\np = .068†\r\n\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n\r\nRealism\r\n\r\np = .017*\r\n\r\n2\r\n1\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n\r\nControl\r\n\r\nAgent Human Our\r\nModel\r\nBaseline\r\nModel Control\r\n\r\nAgent Human Our\r\nModel\r\nBaseline\r\nModel Control\r\nFigure 4. Results from the communicative accuracy, perceived naturalness,\r\nand realism measures. Conditions are from left-to-right: agent control (no\r\ngaze shifts, only idle gaze), human control (video of a gazing human), agents\r\nshifting their gaze using a previously published baseline gaze model [45], and\r\nagents shifting their gaze using our model of gaze.\r\n\r\ngaze models had on how accurately participants identified the\r\n\r\nobject that the agents or the human confederates looked to-\r\nward and the perceived naturalness of the gaze shifts. Overall,\r\n\r\nmodel type had a significant effect on communicative accuracy,\r\nF(7, 46.67) = 16.77, p < .001, and perceived naturalness,\r\nF(7, 46.67) = 151.03, p < .001.\r\nPairwise comparisons found no significant differences in\r\nthe communicative accuracy of the gaze shifts produced\r\nby our model and those produced by human confederates,\r\n\r\nF(1, 14.91) = 0.03, p = ns. Similarly, no differences in ac-\r\ncuracy were found between our model and the baseline model,\r\n\r\nF(1, 1958) = 0.17, p = ns. The results suggest that the gaze\r\nshifts generated by our model are just as accurate as those\r\nperformed by human confederates and those generated by the\r\nbaseline model.\r\nComparisons across conditions showed that participants rated\r\ngaze shifts generated by our model as marginally more natural\r\nthan those generated by the baseline model, F(1, 1967) =\r\n3.34, p = .068. Comparisons over realism (one of the items\r\nincluded in the perceived naturalness scale) found that gaze\r\nshifts produced by our model were rated as significantly\r\nmore realistic than those generated by the baseline model,\r\n\r\nF(1, 1963) = 5.75, p = .017. Results on the communica-\r\ntive accuracy, perceived naturalness, and realism measures are\r\n\r\nillustrated in Figure 4.\r\nEXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION\r\nThe validated model of gaze shifts provides parameters that\r\n\r\nallow us to explore how manipulation of these low-level param-\r\neters can achieve valuable high-level effects. The main study\r\n\r\nof this paper explores manipulating the head alignment param-\r\neter in order to create more affiliative or more referential gaze\r\n\r\ncues, with the goal of increasing feelings of connection with\r\nthe agent and increasing learning respectively. The experiment\r\nwas carried out in the context of an educational scenario, with\r\nthe virtual agent serving as a lecturer to the human participant.\r\nThe virtual agent taught the participant about a specific subject\r\nfrom ancient Chinese history. A map of China was used as\r\n\r\na reference to facilitate the descriptions of geographical loca-\r\ntions. An example of the interface presented to participants is\r\n\r\nshown in Figure 1.\r\nHypotheses\r\nWe designed an experiment to test three hypotheses. First, we\r\nwished to merely confirm that the presence of an agent will\r\nelicit better learning than only audio.\r\nHypothesis 1 – The presence of an embodied agent will result\r\nin better recall performance than only hearing audio with no\r\naccompanying agent.\r\nThe literature strongly supports the first hypothesis, in which\r\nit is shown that teachers who gaze at their students lead the\r\nstudents to learn better [41, 47]. We seek to show these same\r\neffects can be achieved by virtual agents using our gaze model.\r\nHypothesis 2 – An agent which employs more affiliative gaze\r\n(maintains higher head alignment with the participant) will\r\ngarner higher subjective evaluations than one which uses more\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 709\r\n\r\nStorytelling\r\n\r\nMap\r\n\r\nBoth\r\nReferential\r\nAliative\r\n\r\nHuman\r\n(Participant)\r\nVirtual Space Physical Space\r\n\r\nVirtual Agent\r\n\r\nHu\r\n\r\nBoth\r\nReferentia\r\nl Space\r\n\r\nFigure 5. A diagram of the setup of the study showing the range of the agent’s\r\nhead movements for each gaze condition. The agent’s eye motions (not\r\ndepicted) always move the full distance from eye contact with the participant\r\nto eye contact with each map location being referred to.\r\nreferential gaze (maintains higher head alignment with the\r\ninformation being referred to).\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis is supported by the fact that people are per-\r\nceived as being more intelligent, more trustworthy, and more\r\n\r\nfriendly if they make more direct eye contact [1, 14]. We wish\r\nto extend this work to show that head alignment makes an\r\nimpact on the positive subjective effects of mutual gaze, and\r\nthat our model is capable of achieving these effects.\r\nHypothesis 3 – Viewing an agent using more referential gaze\r\nshould result in better recall performance. This will especially\r\nbe true when the information to be recalled relies on building\r\nassociations to objects in the environment.\r\nReferential gaze helps build associations between information\r\nand objects in the environment. In communication between\r\na human and virtual agent with a shared environment, being\r\nable to perceive the agent’s eye gaze to different objects in\r\nthe environment reduces the time and verbal communication\r\nneeded for grounding references [34]. We believe that head\r\nalignment has the ability to strengthen or weaken this effect\r\nsince it plays a substantial role in shifting a viewer’s visual\r\nattention [23]. When the agent’s head is aligned more fully\r\nwith the object under consideration, this should serve as a\r\nstronger referential gaze cue than if the head is not aligned.\r\nWe wish to show that our gaze model can achieve this effect.\r\nParticipants\r\nWe recruited 20 participants for our study (10 males and\r\n10 females), with ages ranging from 19 to 65 (M = 27.8,\r\nSD = 14.3). Fifteen participants were students and five were\r\nworking members of the community. All were native English\r\n\r\nspeakers. Student participants came from a number of differ-\r\nent fields, including psychology, engineering, and business.\r\n\r\nAll participants were recruited using a combination of campus\r\nflyers and on-line student job forums.\r\nStudy Design\r\nWe employed a within-subjects design for this study. Our\r\nexperiment involved one factor, type of gaze, with four levels,\r\neach of which is defined as follows:\r\n• Audio: The agent is shown briefly during its introduction. Then\r\nthe lights in the virtual scene are extinguished for the duration of\r\nthe lecture, except for a spotlight on the map, so only the map\r\n\r\ncan be seen and the agent is in complete darkness. At the end of\r\nthe lecture, the scene lights turn back on for the agent to give its\r\ninstructions to the participant on taking the subjective evaluation\r\nand quiz for the lecture.\r\n• Affiliative: The agent keeps its head aligned with the participant\r\nas much as possible during the lecture. When the agent is making\r\ndirect eye contact with the participant, the head is fully aligned\r\nwith the participant. When the agent shifts its eye gaze to refer to\r\nsomething on the map, the head aligns as little as possible with the\r\nmap – as much as the agent’s OMR will allow – so as to keep the\r\nhead aligned towards the participant.\r\n• Referential: The agent keeps its head aligned with the map as\r\nmuch as possible during the lecture. When the agent is gazing\r\nat the map, the head is fully aligned with the map. When the\r\nagent shifts its eye gaze back to the participant, the head aligns\r\nas little as possible with the participant – as much as the agent’s\r\nOMR will allow – so as to keep the head aligned towards the\r\nmap. The referential condition is “more referential” (borrowing\r\nthe term “referential” from linguistics) because the head maintains\r\nalignment with the information being referred to on the map, both\r\nwhen looking at the participant (out of the corner of the eyes) and\r\nwhen looking at the map (head and eyes fully aligned).\r\n• Both: When gazing at the participant, the agent keeps its head\r\nfully aligned to the participant. When gazing at the map, the agent\r\naligns its head fully with the map.\r\nFigure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate the difference in head motion\r\nbetween the three conditions affiliative, referential, and both.\r\nIt should be stressed that in all three of these conditions, the\r\nagent’s eyes move the full distance from eye contact with the\r\nparticipant to each map location being referred to. The agent’s\r\neyes always converged on each map location while it was\r\nbeing referred to.\r\nEach participant viewed four lectures given by four different\r\nvirtual agents, each utilizing a different gaze condition. Thus,\r\nevery participant was exposed to all four gaze conditions. All\r\nagents, three of which can be seen in Figures 1 and 6, were\r\nspecifically designed to look and sound androgynous so as\r\nto eliminate gender biases as much as possible. Each agent\r\nalways gave the same lecture, but pairings between agent and\r\ngaze condition were stratified across participants for balance.\r\nMap Participant\r\n\r\nReferential/Both Map Referential Participant\r\nA B\r\n\r\nC D\r\n\r\nFigure 6.

The physical setup of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe order in which the lectures – and accordingly gaze con-\r\nditions – were presented to the participants was completely\r\n\r\nrandomized to offset any bias due to fatigue. Lectures were\r\nalso kept informationally distinct in an attempt to decrease\r\nlearning bias. Each lecture was carefully controlled to be near\r\nthe same length–approximately three minutes.\r\nDuring each lecture, the agent makes eleven gaze shifts to\r\nthe map, each followed shortly by a gaze shift back to the\r\nparticipant. The agent fixates its gaze on different targets on\r\nthe map as they are mentioned, e.g. while giving facts about a\r\nChinese city visible on the map. Timing of this gaze shift is\r\ndone according to Griffin [19] and Meyer et al. [38], which\r\nindicate that a deictic gaze shift should occur 800 - 1000 ms\r\nbefore the object being gazed at is mentioned in speech.\r\nImplementation – The experiment was implemented using\r\na custom framework built on top of the Unity game engine\r\n(www.unity3d.com). The gaze model was implemented as\r\n\r\na Unity script. The characters were created using a com-\r\nmercially available parametric base figure. Audio was pre-\r\nrecorded and pitch-shifted to sound androgynous.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\nThe experiment was conducted in a closed study room with\r\nno outside distraction. Participants entered the experiment\r\nroom and were asked to sit at a table with a single computer\r\nmonitor and mouse. The monitor was a 32-inch flat panel\r\ndisplay, allowing the virtual agent representation (only head\r\nand shoulders) to be near life size. This setup can be seen in\r\n\r\nFigure 7. The experimenter gave the participant a brief de-\r\nscription of what they would be asked to do in the experiment,\r\n\r\nand then asked them to review and sign a consent form. The\r\nexperimenter told the participants that they were going to be\r\nlistening to and quizzed on four short lectures from different\r\nvirtual lecturers, each on a topic pertaining to ancient China.\r\nAfter consenting, the experimenter told participants that they\r\ncould press the start button on the screen after he left the room.\r\nUpon pressing the start button, the first lecturer (randomly\r\nchosen by the software) began introducing itself and giving its\r\nlecture. Upon completion of the lecture the screen went black,\r\nand participants filled out on paper a subjective evaluation of\r\n\r\nthe lecturer they had just viewed, followed by a quiz on the ma-\r\nterial presented in the lecture. During the initial instructions,\r\n\r\nthe experimenter made it clear that the quiz was to be filled\r\n\r\nout after the subjective evaluation had been completed. This\r\nallows the subjective evaluation to double as distractor task,\r\nstrengthening any subsequent recall measures. All participants\r\nwere monitored via closed-circuit camera by the experimenter\r\n\r\nto ensure that these instructions were followed, but no partici-\r\npants were observed to neglect the instructions.\r\n\r\nAfter filling out the subjective evaluation and quiz, the par-\r\nticipant could go back to the monitor and click the on-screen\r\n\r\nbutton to begin the next lecture. This process was repeated\r\nuntil all four lectures had been viewed, rated, and quizzed.\r\nAt this point, the experimenter re-entered the room with a\r\nshort questionnaire of demographic information. Following\r\ncompletion of the questionnaire, the experimenter debriefed\r\n\r\nand payed the participant. The total experiment took approxi-\r\nmately 30 minutes, and participants were paid $5.\r\n\r\nMeasures\r\n\r\nOur experiment involved one independent manipulated vari-\r\nable, type of gaze, manipulated within participants. The depen-\r\ndent variables included objective measurements for evaluating\r\n\r\nparticipants’ recall of the lecture material and subjective mea-\r\nsurements for evaluating the participants’ impressions of the\r\n\r\nvirtual agent.\r\nThe objective measurement of recall involved quizzes taken\r\nby all participants following each lecture. Each quiz had\r\nten short-answer questions. These questions were split into\r\n\r\nthree categories (not visible to the participant). One cate-\r\ngory included three questions that asked about information\r\n\r\nnot directly associated with information on the map. Thus,\r\nreferential gaze should not have had an effect on the recall\r\nof this information. An example question in this category\r\nwould be, “In what year did the Jin dynasty overtake control\r\nof China?” The Jin dynasty was not represented on the map\r\nduring the associated lecture. The second category, consisting\r\nof four questions, asked about purely spatial information. For\r\n\r\nexample, one question here was “Which of the Three King-\r\ndoms dynasties extended farthest south?” This question is only\r\n\r\nanswerable by having studied the map. The third category,\r\nincluding the remaining three questions of the quiz, relied\r\non building associations between verbal lecture content and\r\nspatial map locations. For example, “Give one reason why\r\nEmperor Wen declared the city of Luoyang to be his capital\r\n\r\ncity.” Referential gaze was expected to make the biggest im-\r\npact on questions from the latter two categories. Questions\r\n\r\nfrom all three categories were randomly permutated to create\r\nthe final ten-question quiz.\r\n\r\nThe subjective measurements were split into six broad indica-\r\ntors. Each question within the indicators took the form of a\r\n\r\nseven-point rating scale. Item reliability (Cronbach’s α) was\r\nacceptable or better for all except skilled communicator.\r\n1. Likeability: Four-item measure of how likeable the participant\r\nfound the agent to be. Includes questions on perceived friendliness\r\nand helpfulness. (Cronbach’s α = .78)\r\n\r\n2. Rapport: Six-item measure of how much the participant felt feel-\r\nings of rapport in relation to the agent. Questions asked, e.g., how\r\n\r\nwell the participant felt he or she connected with the agent and\r\nhow willingly he or she would disclose personal information to\r\nthe virtual agent following the lecture. (Cronbach’s α = .84)\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 711\r\n\r\nFigure 9. Objective measure (recall measured by post-lecture quiz). On\r\nthe left is the total quiz performance, on the right is the quiz performance\r\nwhen only considering a subset of the questions: those dealing with spatial\r\ninformation and building associations.\r\n\r\n3. Trust: Two-item measure of how trustworthy the participant per-\r\nceived the agent to be. Includes ratings of trustworthiness and\r\n\r\nhonesty. (Cronbach’s α = .72)\r\n4. Intelligence: Three-item measure of how intelligent the participant\r\nperceived the agent to be. Includes ratings of competence and\r\nexpertise. (Cronbach’s α = .84)\r\n5. Skilled Communicator: Three-item measure of how effective at\r\nconveying lecture material the participant perceived the agent to\r\nbe. Item reliability was questionable (Cronbach’s α = .62)\r\n6. Engagement: Six-item measure of how engaged the participant felt\r\nduring the lecture. Includes personal ratings of focus, attentiveness,\r\nand satisfaction. (Cronbach’s α = .89)\r\nManipulation Checks\r\nTo check that our gaze type manipulations were being noticed\r\nbetween the visible agent conditions, we asked the participants\r\nto rate from 0% to 100% how much they felt the agent was\r\npaying attention to them and to the map. We expected that\r\nparticipants would feel more attended to in the affiliative and\r\nboth conditions than in the referential condition. Conversely,\r\nwe expected participants to feel like the agent was attending\r\nto the map more in the referential and both gaze conditions\r\nthan in the affiliative condition.\r\nResults\r\nAnalysis of our data was conducted using a repeated measures\r\nanalysis of variance (ANOVA). We used Tukey-Kramer HSD\r\n\r\nto control the experiment-wise error rate in all post-hoc tests.\r\nOur analysis started with the manipulation check. We found\r\n\r\nthat participants felt more attended to in the affiliative gaze con-\r\ndition versus the referential condition, F(1, 69) = 12.53, p <\r\n\r\n.001. They also felt more attended to in the both condition\r\n\r\nversus referential, F(1, 69) = 4.37, p = .040. Finally, par-\r\nticipants felt that the agent attended to the map more in the\r\n\r\nreferential condition versus affiliative, F(1, 69) = 7.75, p =\r\n.007. This difference was not found to be significant for the\r\nboth condition versus affiliative, F(1, 69) = 0.37, p = .55,\r\nhowever participants rated the agent as attending more to\r\nthe map in the referential condition over the both condition,\r\nF(1, 69) = 4.75, p = .033.\r\nNext we analyzed the objective results in the form of recall\r\n\r\nquiz scores (Figure 9). In terms of overall score, the au-\r\ndio condition resulted in significantly lower recall than the\r\n\r\nother three visible agent conditions, including affiliative gaze,\r\nF(1, 69) = 19.38, p < .001, referential gaze, F(1, 69) =\r\n37.78, p < .001, and both, F = 31.91, p < .001. When\r\nconsidering only the seven (out of ten total) questions that\r\n\r\ndealt with purely spatial map information and building asso-\r\nciations between verbal lecture content and locations on the\r\n\r\nmap, we found that the referential gaze condition resulted in\r\nsignificantly better recall performance than the affiliative gaze\r\ncondition, F(1, 69) = 5.62, p = .021. The increase in recall\r\nperformance from the both condition over affiliative does not\r\n\r\nquite reach significance, F(1, 69) = 2.58, p = .11. Refer-\r\nential and both were not significantly different, F(1, 69) =\r\n\r\n0.59, p = .45.\r\n\r\nFinally, we analyzed the subjective measures. Here we ob-\r\nserved that on the likeability scale, the referential condition\r\n\r\nrated lower than both the affiliative condition, F(1, 69) =\r\n58.86, p < .001, and both condition, F(1, 69) = 52.65, p <\r\n.001. On the rapport scale, the referential condition also rated\r\nlower than both affiliative, F(1, 69) = 13.25, p < .001, and\r\nboth, F(1, 69) = 7.95, p = .006. The trust scale had similar\r\nresults, with the referential condition rated lower than both\r\naffiliative, F(1, 69) = 8.63, p = .005, and both, F(1, 69) =\r\n\r\n5.55, p = .021. The intelligence scale again shows the referen-\r\ntial condition getting rated lower than affiliative, F(1, 69) =\r\n\r\n11.38, p = .001, and both, F(1, 69) = 10.99, p = .002. The\r\n\r\nskilled communicator scale yielded no significant results be-\r\nFigure 8. Results for subjective evaluations (likeability, rapport, trust, intelligence, skilled communicator, and engagement) based on gaze condition.\r\n\r\nSession: Interacting With Robots & Agents CHI 2012, May 5–10, 2012, Austin, Texas, USA 712\r\n\r\ntween conditions, but the engagement scale showed the ref-\r\nerential condition getting rated significantly lower than the\r\n\r\naffiliative condition, F(1, 69) = 14.53, p < .001, and both\r\ncondition, F(1, 69) = 17.16, p < .001. These results are\r\nsummarized in Figure 8.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe purpose of the experiment was to demonstrate how subtle\r\n\r\nchanges in gaze behavior can lead to significant high-level ef-\r\nfects, with the goal of improving learning and positive feelings\r\n\r\nof affiliation. To do this, we manipulated the head align-\r\nment parameter in our model implemented on various virtual\r\n\r\nlecturing agents. We showed that by manipulating just this\r\n\r\nparameter for a virtual agent shifting its gaze from the partici-\r\npant to an object in the scene (i.e., the map of China) and back\r\n\r\nagain, the agent could achieve very different subjective and\r\nobjective effects, including the participant’s feelings toward\r\nthe agent and information recall respectively.\r\nConfirming our first hypothesis, the mere presence of an agent\r\nresulted in better recall performance than audio alone, no\r\nmatter which gaze condition was being used. For five out of\r\nsix subjective scales, the affiliative and both gaze conditions\r\nachieved better ratings than the referential condition. This\r\nleads us to accept our second hypothesis, showing that human\r\nlisteners prefer when the virtual agent speaker aligns its head\r\nfully with the participant while speaking, rather than looking\r\nout of the corners of its eyes with its head aligned towards\r\n\r\nsomething else. The skilled communicator scale did not ex-\r\nhibit this effect, which could mean that participants thought\r\n\r\nthe agent was doing a similarly decent job of communicating\r\nthe lecture content no matter which gaze condition was used.\r\nWe also have strong support for our third hypothesis, where\r\nwe showed that referential gaze results in better participant\r\nrecall than affiliative gaze. By keeping its head aligned with\r\n\r\nthe map as much as possible, the agent compelled the partic-\r\nipant to concentrate more on the map and learn the spatial\r\n\r\nlocations better, while building associations between verbal\r\nlecture content and those same locations. As a reminder, the\r\n\r\nsame amount of gaze was used by the agent in both the affilia-\r\ntive and referential gaze conditions. Hence in both conditions\r\n\r\nthe participant was able to benefit from gaze as an arousal\r\nstimulus to learn the lecture material better. The difference\r\nlies in the way each gaze shift was performed, proving that\r\n\r\nnot all ways of gazing are equal and subtle changes can cre-\r\nate significant outcomes. Overall, this study showed that our\r\n\r\nmodel was capable of achieving targeted outcomes.\r\nDesign Implications\r\n\r\nEmbodied agents’ potential in computer interfaces is increas-\r\ning with the ever-growing popularity of interactive games and\r\n\r\ncomputer-based tools for learning, motivation, and rehabilita-\r\ntion. However, agent designers need controllable models of\r\n\r\ninteractive behavior and evidence that these models effectively\r\nimprove outcomes such as learning and rapport. Our work\r\nprovides one such example in the context of gaze.\r\nWe have shown that it is possible to implement in virtual\r\nagents the very subtle gaze cues that humans use to great\r\neffect in social situations, and that manipulating these cues\r\ncan achieve significant objective and subjective high-level\r\n\r\neffects in a human interacting with the agent. Designers of\r\nvirtual agents can use these subtle gaze behaviors, such as head\r\nalignment, to reach different desired outcomes. If the agent\r\ndesigner wants human interlocutors to pay more attention to\r\nspecific objects in the environment, possibly to learn more\r\nabout them, the agent could be programmed to use high head\r\nalignment when gazing to those objects. Similarly, if the agent\r\ndesigner wants the agent to build a stronger relationship with\r\nthe human interlocutor, increasing feelings of, e.g., rapport\r\nand trust, the agent should be programmed to use high head\r\nalignment when gazing towards the human. Our model of\r\ngaze behavior offers a simple and effective means to control\r\nthe low-level gaze parameters found in physiological research.\r\nVirtual agent designers can use and build off of this model\r\nto create rich, compelling gaze behaviors that accomplish the\r\nhigh-level effects they wish to achieve.\r\nLimitations and Future Work\r\n\r\nOur gaze mechanisms are currently focused on the contribu-\r\ntions of the head and eyes alone. Future extensions should\r\n\r\nconsider the movement of other body parts, such as employing\r\n\r\nthe neck in performing head movements. While the work pre-\r\nsented here explored our gaze shift model on very humanlike\r\n\r\ncharacters, we intend to explore its application to different\r\ncharacter designs, e.g., stylized cartoons, and embodiments,\r\ne.g., storytelling robots [39]. We also intend to run future\r\nstudies exercising different parameters of the model (e.g., head\r\n\r\nlatency) and measuring the effects of subtle gaze cues in dif-\r\nferent interaction modalities, such as VR and mobile devices.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\nGaze is a complex and powerful cue. Through subtle changes\r\n\r\nin gaze, people can achieve a wide range of social and com-\r\nmunicative goals, affecting their partner of interaction in a\r\n\r\nvariety of different ways. Gaze cues, as with all embodied\r\ncommunication cues, hold a strong fundamental connection\r\nwith key social, cognitive, and task outcomes. This connection\r\nreveals an opportunity for designing embodied dialog with\r\nvirtual agents. Designing gaze behaviors for virtual agents\r\nthat can achieve specifically targeted high-level outcomes has\r\nlong been a difficult problem. By creating a mechanism for\r\n\r\nsynthesizing gaze shifts in a natural, yet parameterized fash-\r\nion, we have provided a building block for creating high-level\r\n\r\nsocial and communicative behaviors. In this paper we pre-\r\nsented a model of gaze shifts validated to achieve humanlike\r\n\r\ngaze for virtual agents, and a study which shows that it can\r\nachieve interesting subjective and objective effects through\r\nmanipulation of low-level gaze parameters. These subtle gaze\r\ncues are effective in the context of our gaze model due to\r\nthe grounded physiological approach we took in designing it.\r\nBy manipulating and combining them in different ways, we\r\nbelieve that virtual agents will soon have access to a rich new\r\nsource of possible gaze behaviors, resulting in human-agent\r\ninteractions that are more effective and rewarding.\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\nThis research was supported by National Science Founda-\r\ntion award 1017952.

Specically, we sought to replicate the classic social facilitation/inhibition effects\r\n\r\nwherein individuals’ performance on a task is affected by the presence of others. Within\r\n\r\nan IVE, participants mastered one of two tasks and subsequently performed the mas-\r\ntered or nonmastered task either alone or in the presence of a virtual human audience\r\n\r\nwhom they were led to believe were either computer-controlled agents or human-\r\ncontrolled avatars. Those performing in the presence of avatars demonstrated classic\r\n\r\nsocial inhibition performance impairment effects relative to those performing alone or in\r\nthe presence of agents. We discuss important elements involved in the experience of\r\nsocial inuence within immersive virtual environments.\r\n\r\n1 Int rod uct ion\r\n\r\nAn historical examination of research reports in social psychology yields a fas-\r\ncinating observation: the experimental methods employed are often as, and sometimes\r\n\r\nmore, interesting than the scientic ndings themselves. This is due largely to the\r\nscientic creativity exhibited in producing the illusory scenarios that are necessary to\r\n\r\nanswer important research questions in social psychology, a eld dened as “an at-\r\ntempt to understand and explain how the thought, feeling, and behavior of individu-\r\nals are inuenced by the actual, imagined or implied presence of others” (Allport,\r\n\r\n1985, p. 3). Some have even suggested that the history of methodology in experi-\r\nmental social psychology is a history, literally, of illusions (Korn, 1997).\r\n\r\n2 Illusion in Social Psy chology\r\n\r\nAlthough social psychologists relish the rigorous control of objective, empir-\r\nical investigations, it can prove quite difcult at times to perform the requisite ex-\r\nperimental manipulations in the laboratory. Often, we must induce affect, cogni-\r\ntions, and/or motivations in our participants, but the effect of our manipulations\r\n\r\nis limited both by the effect of our experimental illusions and by the participants’\r\nattentional, motivational, and imaginative capacities. Thus, we value experimenter\r\ncreativity in devising effective experimental scenarios that fuel the imaginations of\r\n\r\nour participants. Our experimental manipulations require us to make the assump-\r\ntion that our participants believe our illusions, whether by actively cooperating in\r\n\r\nstaged scenarios (such as role playing) or by believing our deceptive cover stories\r\n(Mixon, 1972).\r\n\r\nHoyt et al. 183\r\n\r\nCommon experimental manipulation techniques involve\r\n\r\nthe use of vignettes, verbal instructions, video and com-\r\nputer displays, and confederates. If given the opportunity,\r\n\r\nmost social psychologists would prefer to fully imbed their\r\nparticipants in vignettes or video displays or to have the\r\nsame confederate behave identically with all participants.\r\n\r\nThis capability would likely augment the attentional, moti-\r\nvational, and imaginative capacities of the participants, thus\r\n\r\nmaking it easier for experimenters to meet the assumption\r\nthat participants are psychologically experiencing what they\r\n\r\nwant them to experience. Fortunately, with recent techno-\r\nlogical advances, this ideal might not be so far fetched.\r\n\r\nSpecically, immersive virtual environment technology\r\n(IVET) may be the ultimate tool to help us meet the\r\n\r\nassumption of participant immersion in our experimen-\r\ntal illusions (Loomis, Blascovich, & Beall, 1999).\r\n\r\n3 Immer siv e Virtual Env ironment\r\nTechnology (IVET)\r\n\r\nModern IVET allows users to experience a com-\r\npelling sense of immersion within a circumambient envi-\r\nronment driven by a graphics computer. Blascovich et\r\n\r\nal. (2002) dene virtual environments (VEs) as syn-\r\nthetic sensory information that leads to perceptions of\r\n\r\nenvironments and their contents as if they were not syn-\r\nthetic. Indeed, social psychologists have been creating\r\n\r\nsynthetic experimental scenarios for years (for example,\r\nHaney, Banks, and Zimbardo’s (1973) simulated\r\n\r\nprison). Today, however, we can create immersive vir-\r\ntual environments using digital technology.1\r\n\r\n3 .1 Adv antages of Using IVET\r\nThe tradeoff between experimental control and\r\nmundane realism has plagued social psychology from its\r\ninception. Although researchers generally choose to\r\nmaximize experimental control, they are constantly\r\n\r\nsearching for new and creative methodologies to en-\r\nhance the mundane realism (that is, the extent to which\r\n\r\nan experiment is similar to situations encountered in\r\neveryday life (Aronson & Carlsmith, 1969)) of their\r\n\r\nexperiments. IVET is likely to provide social psychologi-\r\ncal researchers with an improvement (that is, a decrease)\r\n\r\nin this tradeoff by virtue of its more optimal interfaces\r\n\r\nfor the human senses. In addition, IVET provides re-\r\nsearchers with a tool that allows them to perform ma-\r\nnipulations that would be otherwise impossible or ex-\r\ntremely difcult. For example, IVET provides social\r\n\r\npsychologists with a relatively easy way to experimen-\r\ntally manipulate organismic variables such as race or\r\n\r\ngender, which was heretofore nearly impossible. Also,\r\nIVET provides social psychological researchers with an\r\nunobtrusive source of data from their participants. That\r\nis, participants’ movements are continually tracked by\r\nthe system and thus available for data collection. These\r\n\r\ndata can provide important information on social non-\r\nverbal cues such as nodding, posture, and eye gaze\r\n\r\n(Bailenson, Blascovich, Beall, & Loomis, 2001; Bailen-\r\nson, Beall, & Blascovich, 2002).\r\n\r\n3 .2 Social In uence within Immer siv e\r\nVirtual Env ironment s\r\nWe believe the experience of social inuence\r\nwithin immersive virtual environments is a function of a\r\nnumber of factors including realism and perceived\r\nagency. (See Blascovich (2002) and Blascovich et al.\r\n(2002) for reviews of IVET as a methodological tool.)\r\nRealism refers to the degree to which virtual humans\r\nand other objects within immersive virtual environments\r\nbehave as they would in the physical world, whereas\r\nperceived agency refers to the degree to which users\r\nbelieve they are in an environment with other veritable\r\n\r\nhumans. This study is concerned primarily with examin-\r\n1. We acknowledge that we use a denition that departs from those of\r\n\r\nother researchers in the eld of VEs who have tied their denitions to\r\ndigital technology, and we don’t do so lightly. However, we believe\r\nstrongly that our generic denition, which has appeared in more or less\r\nthe same form in several places in the published literature (Blascovich,\r\n2002; Blascovich et al., 2002) is important precisely because it is not tied\r\nto a specic technology. Technologies for creating virtual environments\r\nhave indeed changed over time and will continue to do so in the future,\r\nbut, the underlying principles of social interaction within virtual environ- ments may not be and most likely are not tied to specic technologies.\r\n\r\nHence, we can learn much from research in elds such as social psy-\r\nchology that has examined behaviors in virtual environments generi-\r\ncally dened and test and apply what we have learned to digital virtual\r\n\r\nenvironments, especially regarding social inuence and interaction.\r\n184 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\ning the role of perceived agency in social inuence\r\nwithin immersive virtual environments.\r\n\r\nIn our terminology, we use the term avatar to de-\r\nscribe a graphical character that is controlled by a hu-\r\nman being in real time. We use the term agent to refer\r\n\r\nto a graphical character that is controlled by a computer\r\nprogram or articial intelligence algorithm. Thus, an\r\navatar is the virtual embodiment or representation of a\r\n\r\nhuman interactant, and an agent is the virtual embodi-\r\nment of a computer program that has been designed to\r\n\r\ninteract with, or on behalf of, a human. The primary\r\npurpose of embodiment (that is, giving a human user or\r\na computerized agent a graphical representation within\r\na VE) is to give users the sense that there is someone\r\nelse present with them in a virtual environment (which\r\nis often referred to as a sense of copresence).\r\nGoffman (1963) suggested that copresence exists\r\nwhen people sense that they are able to perceive others\r\nand that those others are able to perceive them. To the\r\n\r\nextent that users feel copresent with another while en-\r\ngaged in an interaction within a VE, they should be-\r\ncome more involved and immersed in the interaction,\r\n\r\nand the presence of the other should exert greater social\r\ninuence. All else being equal, users should experience\r\nless copresence when interacting with agents compared\r\nto avatars. Thus, we expect greater levels of social inu- ence with avatars than with agents. However, as stated,\r\n\r\nwe believe other parameters, such as realism, also mod-\r\nerate this relationship. Indeed, Pertaub, Slater, and\r\n\r\nBarker (2002) showed how enhancing the realism of\r\nagents leads to social inuence (such as the induction of\r\nsocial anxiety and fear of public speaking). In this study,\r\nwe held realism constant at a minimal level to examine\r\nthe independent role of perceived agency in social inu- ence within immersive virtual environments.\r\n\r\n4 Classic Social In uence Effect s\r\n\r\nA promising approach to demonstrating the com-\r\nparability of IVET-based research to traditional meth-\r\nods is to attempt to replicate classic social inuence phe-\r\nnomena within IVEs. That is, comparing data from\r\n\r\nvirtual replications to the classic non-IVET obtained\r\n\r\neffects informs us about whether participants exhibit\r\nsimilar responses in both environments. Reliable and\r\nclassic social inuence phenomena that lend themselves\r\nwell to experimentation in an IVE are the well-known\r\nsocial facilitation and social inhibition effects.\r\n\r\n4 .1 Social Facilitat ion and Social\r\nInhibit ion\r\n\r\nFrom Triplett’s (1898) seminal investigation dem-\r\nonstrating that children perform better when winding\r\n\r\nshing reels in a group setting than alone, to contempo-\r\nrary research into biopsychosocial accounts of the effects\r\n\r\nof presence of others on performance (Blascovich,\r\nMendes, Hunter, & Salomon, 1999), social facilitation\r\nand inhibition effects have had a profound impact on\r\nthe eld of social psychology. Initially, social facilitation\r\n\r\nreferred to the presence of co-actors enhancing perfor-\r\nmance (Triplett, 1898). However, subsequent research\r\n\r\nhas more clearly dened the effect of the presence of\r\n\r\nothers on performance. Social facilitation refers to en-\r\nhancement effects, and social inhibition refers to the\r\n\r\nimpairment effects driven by the presence of others,\r\nwhether they are co-actors or mere observers.\r\nZajonc’s (1965) landmark review and analysis of the\r\nearly literature on social facilitation and social inhibition\r\neffects revived theoretical accounts and debate about\r\n\r\nthe phenomenon. Zajonc demonstrated that the pres-\r\nence of others serves to enhance performance on well-\r\nlearned, or dominant, responses but impairs perfor-\r\nmance on novel, or subordinate, responses. He\r\n\r\nproposed a theoretical model of social facilitation and\r\ninhibition effects that is dependent on arousal and task\r\ncomplexity. Specically, he posited that the presence of\r\nothers increases arousal that in turn facilitates dominant\r\n\r\nresponses and impairs subordinate responses. Thus, per-\r\nformance on well-learned tasks is augmented by the\r\n\r\npresence of others whereas performance on novel tasks\r\nis diminished. Zajonc specied that this generalized\r\narousal is a novel response to the presence of others.\r\n\r\nShortly after Zajonc’s model appeared, various theo-\r\nrists added to the knowledge of social facilitation and\r\n\r\ninhibition processes (Taylor, Peplau, & Sears, 1997).\r\n\r\nEvaluation apprehension theorists explained that, on sim-\r\nHoyt et al. 185\r\n\r\nple tasks, an awareness that we are being judged can moti-\r\nvate us to greater effort; on complex tasks, however, the\r\n\r\npressure of evaluation may be harmful. Specically, Cot-\r\ntrell, Wack, Sekerak, and Rittle (1968) proposed and\r\n\r\ntested the notion that facilitation of dominant responses\r\n\r\nstems from anticipated evaluations from others and, in-\r\ndeed, found facilitation effects only when others could\r\n\r\nevaluate the participants’ performance.\r\n\r\n5 Social Facilitat ion and Virtual\r\nEnv ironment s: Exper imental Ov erv iew\r\n\r\nIn this experiment, we attempted to replicate so-\r\ncial facilitation and social inhibition effects in an immer-\r\nsive virtual setting. Successful replication would provide\r\n\r\ninsight into the conditions necessary for the IVE user to\r\n\r\nexperience social inuence effects. Specically, partici-\r\npants in this study learned either a categorization or\r\n\r\npattern recognition task to criterion and subsequently\r\nwere randomly assigned to perform either the same or a\r\n\r\ndifferent task alone or in the presence of two virtual ob-\r\nservers. The perceived agency of the virtual observers\r\n\r\nwas manipulated such that half of the participants\r\nwere led to believe they were being observed by two\r\ncomputer-controlled agents, and the other half were led\r\nto believe that the virtual observers were avatars (that is,\r\nrepresentations of other real people who were in the\r\nvirtual environment with them).\r\n\r\nBased on the social evaluation inherent in the situa-\r\ntion, we hypothesized that social facilitation and social\r\n\r\ninhibition would be exhibited in the avatar but not the\r\n\r\nagent or alone conditions. In addition, we expected par-\r\nticipants in the avatar condition to report a greater sense\r\n\r\nof copresence than would participants in the agent con-\r\ndition and that this enhanced sense of copresence would\r\n\r\nat least partially mediate any differences in performance\r\nbetween participants in the agent and avatar conditions.\r\n5 .1 Method\r\n5.1.1 Design and Overview. To test for social\r\ninuence in the virtual environment, we conducted a 2\r\n(task type: novel or well-learned) 3 3 (audience type:\r\n\r\nagent, avatar, or alone) fully factorial between-partici-\r\npants experiment. The experiment consisted of two\r\n\r\nphases: learning and testing. Participants rst learned\r\n\r\none of two randomly assigned tasks to a predened cri-\r\nterion. In the testing phase, participants were randomly\r\n\r\nassigned to perform the learned or the unlearned task\r\n\r\neither alone, in the presence of an agent, or in the pres-\r\nence of an avatar. The two tasks were counterbalanced\r\n\r\nwithin the experimental design.\r\n\r\n5.1.2 Settings and Participants. The experi-\r\nment was conducted at the University of California– Santa Barbara. Forty-eight undergraduate students ei-\r\nther received course credit in introductory psychology\r\n\r\nor were paid $10.00 for their participation. Nine partici-\r\npants were excluded from analyses due to their failure to\r\n\r\nlearn to criterion in the rst phase. Thus, data from 39\r\nparticipants (15 men and 24 women) are reported.\r\n5.1.3 Apparatus. In this experiment, participants\r\nwere immersed in a three-dimensional digital virtual\r\nlaboratory environment. The immersive virtual display\r\nsystem used to engage the participants consisted of\r\nthree subsystems: a head tracker, a graphics computer,\r\nand an audiovisual head-mounted display (HMD).\r\n(See gure 1.)\r\nDue to constant technological advancements in our\r\nlab, the type of head tracker used in this experiment was\r\nchanged after roughly one-fourth of the participants\r\ntook part in the experiment. The rst tracking system\r\ndetected only head rotation whereas the second system\r\ndetected translation as well. The rst head tracker was\r\nan Intersense IS-300 series precision motion tracker\r\nwith three degrees of freedom to detect yaw, pitch, and\r\nroll; the angular resolution for the Intersense was 0.02\r\ndeg. The head tracker used for the remainder of the\r\n\r\nparticipants was Shooting Star’s model ADL-1 goniom-\r\neter which had six degrees of freedom to detect motion\r\n\r\nalong the x, y, and z coordinates as well as yaw, pitch,\r\nand roll rotations.\r\nA 400 MHz Pentium II PC with 128 MB of RAM\r\ngenerated a stream of images for each eye. The core\r\nrendering software, Vizard, was designed in-house, and\r\ncontained an OpenGL-based graphics library. Python,\r\n\r\n186 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\nan object-oriented programming language, was used to\r\nscript interactive behaviors in the IVE. Initially, software\r\non a separate PC (a 300 MHz Pentium II with 64 MB\r\nof RAM) was used to determine the orientation of the\r\nhead and then communicated that information to the\r\ngraphics computer over an RS-232 serial line running at\r\n38,400 baud. Later, the tracking software was installed\r\non the graphics computer itself. The peripheral button\r\nbox from which the participants gave their responses\r\n\r\nwas read from a digital I/O port of Advantech’s PCL-\r\n812 multi I/O card.\r\n\r\nThe HMD was a Virtual Research V8 consisting of a\r\nbinocular LCD display with 6403480 resolution. This\r\nexperiment was conducted in unocular model (the same\r\nimage projected to both eyes). The eld of view of the\r\ndisplay was 60 deg. diagonal. The HMDs used by the\r\nconfederate assistants, who were ostensibly in the same\r\nvirtual environment as the participant, wore Philips\r\nMagnavox Scuba FX virtual immersion visors.\r\n5.1.4 Stimuli. Off-the-shelf modeling programs\r\nwere used to create the VRML-based 3D models for the\r\n\r\nvirtual laboratory. The virtual laboratory setting con-\r\nsisted of a room with simulated dimensions of approxi-\r\nmately 333 m. Additionally, there was a wooden door\r\n\r\n(approximately 132.5 m) on the northeast wall, and a\r\nconsole with a computer screen situated directly in front\r\nof the participant.\r\nThe 3D models of the virtual observers were also\r\nmade using the 3D modeling software. One male and\r\n\r\none female observer were created to approximately life-\r\nsize proportions. (See gure 2.) The models were cre-\r\nated in a modular fashion to allow for realistic simula-\r\ntions of three basic nonverbal behaviors: eye movement,\r\n\r\nhead movement, and blinking. Specically, the eyes,\r\n\r\neyelids, heads, and bodies were separate images con-\r\ntrolled independently in the environment. The observ-\r\ners were programmed to randomly generate horizontal\r\n\r\neye movements, eye blinks, and head rotations along\r\nthe yaw, pitch, and roll dimensions to simulate subtle\r\nhead movement.\r\n5.1.5 Performance Tasks. The tasks were\r\nadapted from Blascovich, Mendes, Hunter, and\r\n\r\nSalomon’s (1999) pattern recognition and categoriza-\r\ntion tasks, the latter of which was an adapted version of\r\n\r\nMaddox and Ashby’s (1996) perceptual boundary exer-\r\ncise. These tasks were designed to be equivalent in dif-\r\n\r\nculty yet distinct both visually and substantively. In both\r\ntasks, the participants’ goal was to learn, via feedback,\r\n\r\nFigure 1. Immersive virtual display system.\r\n\r\nFigure 2. The virtual observers.\r\n\r\nHoyt et al. 187\r\n\r\nthe elements by which visual stimuli were sorted into\r\n\r\none of two groups. Specically, participants in the cate-\r\ngorization task were presented with two numbers on\r\n\r\nthe virtual computer screen and were required to deter-\r\nmine whether the numbers belonged to one of two cat-\r\negories. In the pattern recognition task, on the other\r\n\r\nhand, participants viewed a 535 letter matrix on the vir-\r\ntual computer screen, and a word in the matrix was high-\r\nlighted. The participants’ task was to determine whether\r\n\r\nthe word was highlighted in the correct pattern or not.\r\nThe tasks were implemented using Python, and the\r\n\r\nstimuli were presented to participants on a virtual com-\r\nputer screen in a virtual laboratory setting. These tasks\r\n\r\nrequired an interactive series of images projected on the\r\nvirtual computer screen. Specically, the numbers used\r\nin the categorization task were 3D objects that were\r\ntranslated to the appropriate location on the virtual\r\n\r\ncomputer screen whereas the letter matrices of the pat-\r\ntern-recognition task consisted of a series of JPEG com-\r\npressed images that were used as textures mapped di-\r\nrectly onto the virtual computer screen.\r\n\r\nParticipants gave their responses by pressing one of\r\n\r\ntwo buttons on a peripheral device that sent the infor-\r\nmation to the rendering PC, and all responses were\r\n\r\nwritten out to a data collection le. Participants were\r\nprovided immediate audio feedback: a high-pitched\r\ntone followed a correct response and a low-pitched tone\r\nfollowed an incorrect response. If the participants did\r\nnot respond within three to four seconds, their response\r\nwas recorded as incorrect, the low-pitched tone was\r\nplayed, and the next trial ensued.\r\nThe categorization rules for the two tasks varied. In the\r\ncategorization task, the two randomly generated numbers\r\non the computer screen were categorized according to the\r\nnormal distribution to which they belonged. Specically,\r\nthe numbers in group 1 came from a normal distribution\r\nof integers with m 5 46.5, s 5 8, a lower limit of 25, and\r\na higher limit of 68. The normal distribution for the group\r\n2 numbers had a m 5 90.7, s 5 8, and a limited range of\r\n\r\n69 to 112. In the pattern recognition task, the correct pat-\r\ntern consisted of the letters being highlighted one at a\r\n\r\ntime to form a right angle regardless of rotation. Addition-\r\nally, the correct pattern consisted of the letters being high-\r\nlighted consecutively adjacent to one another to form the\r\n\r\nright-angle pattern.\r\nParticipants were randomly assigned to learn one of the\r\ntwo tasks to criterion. Specically, they were required to\r\nmeet or exceed the criterion of getting 80% correct on two\r\nconsecutive blocks. The categorization task consisted of 25\r\ntrials per block, and each block in the pattern recognition\r\ntask was composed of ten trials. During the testing phase\r\nof the experiment the participants completed ve full\r\nblocks of the task. For both tasks, the participants received\r\nfeedback regarding their overall performance following the\r\ncompletion of each block.\r\n\r\n5.1.6 Procedure. Prior to the experiment, par-\r\nticipants were screened by telephone regarding their\r\n\r\nsusceptibility to motion sickness, and vulnerable individ-\r\nuals were not retained for participation. Upon arrival at\r\n\r\nthe experiment site, participants completed another sim-\r\nulator sickness questionnaire as a precaution, provided\r\n\r\ntheir informed consent, and were given instructions re-\r\ngarding the experimental procedures. Next, while\r\n\r\nseated, the participants put on the HMD and began the\r\npractice portion of the experiment. During the practice\r\n\r\nphase, the participants were instructed on how to per-\r\nform both tasks. Specically, they were told the objec-\r\ntive of the tasks, shown how to provide their responses\r\n\r\non a button box, and were led through a sample trial for\r\neach task to familiarize them with the procedures and\r\nthe tones following the correct and incorrect responses.\r\nFollowing this short practice phase, the participants\r\nbegan the learning phase of the experiment. They were\r\ninstructed that following each block (consisting of 25\r\n\r\ntrials in the categorization task and ten trials in the pat-\r\ntern recognition task) they would receive feedback re-\r\ngarding their performance. Participants were required to\r\n\r\nget 80% correct on two consecutive blocks to success-\r\nfully complete the learning phase of the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe experimenter informed the participants that she\r\nwould monitor the experimental room via a live audio\r\nand video feed from the adjoining room, and she left\r\nthe experimental room as the participant began the\r\nlearning phase.\r\n\r\nAfter the participants either learned the task to crite-\r\nrion or completed all possible blocks, the experimenter\r\n\r\n188 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\nreturned and instructed them to remove the HMD for a\r\nshort rest period. During the rest period, participants\r\nreceived instructions specic to their randomly assigned\r\nconditions. Participants assigned to the well-learned task\r\ncondition were informed that they would be performing\r\n\r\nthe same task that they had just completed, and partici-\r\npants in the novel task condition were informed that\r\n\r\nthey would perform the other task.\r\nThose participants in the no-audience condition (that is,\r\nthose performing alone) were simply told they would be\r\ncompleting ve full blocks of their randomly selected task\r\n(novel or well-learned), whereas those assigned to the\r\nagent audience condition were told that during the task\r\nthey were going to be joined in the virtual laboratory by\r\ntwo computer-controlled virtual observers. Finally, in the\r\navatar condition, two assistants entered the experimental\r\nroom with HMDs and goniometers, ostensibly set the\r\nequipment up, and took a seat adjacent to the participants.\r\nThe experimenter informed the participants that these two\r\nassistants would be joining them in the virtual world as\r\nobservers. Additionally, the participants were shown color\r\n\r\npictures of what the observers would look like in the vir-\r\ntual environment and, to augment the illusion, participants\r\n\r\nwere then shown bogus pictures of what they would look\r\nlike in the IVE. That is, participants were presented with a\r\npicture of a virtual human character that matched their\r\ngender, and they were told that this was what they would\r\n\r\nlook like to the two observers within the virtual environ-\r\nment. Only those in the avatar condition were shown rep-\r\nresentations of themselves in an attempt to increase their\r\n\r\nunderstanding of how individuals can be embodied in a\r\nvirtual world.\r\nAs the experimenter exited the room, the participants\r\nbegan the test segment of the experiment in which they\r\ncompleted ve full blocks of one of the two tasks. Upon\r\n\r\ncompletion of the testing phase, the participants com-\r\npleted a short questionnaire and were debriefed and\r\n\r\nthanked for their participation.\r\n5 .2 Measures\r\n\r\n5.2.1 Simulator Sickness Susceptibility Ques-\r\ntionnaire. Before the experiment began, participants\r\n\r\nwere asked to indicate their level of motion sickness sus-\r\nceptibility on a nine-item questionnaire that was devel-\r\noped for this study. Sample items included “Do you get\r\n\r\ncar sick?” and “Do you get sick in airplanes?” No partic-\r\nipants experienced any signicant simulator sickness\r\n\r\nsymptoms at any time during the experiment.\r\n5.2.2 Task Novelty, Task Anxiety, and\r\nCopresence. Upon completion of the experiment,\r\n\r\nparticipants completed a short questionnaire (see Ap-\r\npendix) consisting of three subscales: task novelty (two\r\n\r\nitems, Cronbach’s a 5 .94), task anxiety (two items,\r\nCronbach’s a 5 .72), and copresence (seven items,\r\nCronbach’s a 5 .95). Specically, participants indicated\r\non a seven-point Likert-type scale the extent to which\r\nthe task they performed in the testing phase was novel\r\n(for example, “When I began the nal task, I felt I knew\r\nhow to perform it well” [reversed scored]), the extent\r\nto which they felt anxious about performing the task\r\n(“When I began the nal task, I was nervous”), and, in\r\nthe agent and avatar audience conditions, the extent to\r\n\r\nwhich they felt like there were other real people copre-\r\nsent with them in the virtual environment (“I perceived\r\n\r\nI was in the presence of real people when the virtual\r\n\r\nothers were in the room” or “The virtual others ap-\r\npeared to be sentient (conscious and alive) to me.”)\r\n\r\n5 .3 Result s\r\n5.3.1 Manipulation Checks\r\n5.3.1.1 Task Novelty. The results of a 2 (task type:\r\nnovel or well-learned) 3 3 (audience type: avatar, agent,\r\n\r\nor alone) analysis of variance conrmed that the partici-\r\npants who performed the novel task during the testing\r\n\r\nphase reported that the novel task was signicantly more\r\nnovel (M 5 7.05, s.d. 5 4.05) compared to those who\r\nperformed the well-learned task (M 5 3.00, s.d. 5\r\n1.20), F (1, 33) 5 17.12, p , .001, (h\r\n2 5 .34).\r\n5.3.1.2 Task Anxiety. The results of a 2 (task type:\r\nnovel or well-learned) 3 3 (audience type: avatar, agent,\r\nor alone) analysis of variance also conrmed that the\r\nparticipants who performed the novel task during the\r\ntesting phase reported signicantly higher levels of task\r\nHoyt et al. 189\r\n\r\nanxiety (M 5 5.45, s.d. 5 2.95) compared to partici-\r\npants in the well-learned task condition (M 5 3.53, s.d. 5 1.78), F (1, 33) 5 6.48, p , .05, (h\r\n\r\n2 5 .16).2\r\n5.3.1.3 Copresence. The results of a 2 (task type:\r\nnovel or well-learned) 3 2 (audience type: avatar or\r\nagent) analysis of variance also revealed a strong main\r\neffect of audience type. Specically, participants in the\r\n\r\navatar condition (M 5 36.00, s.d. 5 6.16) reported sig-\r\nnicantly higher levels of copresence than participants in\r\n\r\nthe agent condition (M 5 22.30, s.d. 5 7.07), F (1,\r\n23) 5 32.76, p , .001, (h\r\n\r\n2 5 .59). In addition, there\r\nwas a signicant main effect of task type, F (1, 23) 5\r\n5.64, p , .05 (h\r\n\r\n2 5 .20), which indicated that partici-\r\npants in the learned task condition (M 5 31.65, s.d. 5\r\n\r\n8.50) reported signicantly greater levels of copresence\r\nthan those in the novel task condition (M 5 25.36,\r\ns.d. 5 9.74).3\r\n5.3.2 Analysis of Task Performance Data.\r\nTask performance scores from the testing phase were\r\ncomputed by summing the number of correct responses\r\nacross the ve blocks and converting the result to the\r\n\r\nproportion correct out of all possible trials. Initial analy-\r\nses revealed no signicant main effects for sex or stimuli\r\n\r\ntype (that is, pattern recognition or categorization task)\r\nand no interactions of sex or stimuli type with either\r\nof the two main independent variables. Thus, we\r\ncollapsed across stimuli type and sex for the remaining\r\nanalyses.4\r\n\r\n5.3.2.1 Main Effects Tests. The mean task perfor-\r\nmance scores were submitted to a 3 (audience type: ava-\r\ntar or agent or alone) 3 2 (task type: well-learned or\r\n\r\nnovel) analysis of covariance with task anxiety and task\r\nnovelty entered as covariates.5 Results of this analysis\r\n\r\nrevealed a signicant main effect for task type such that,\r\n\r\nas expected, participants in the well-learned task condi-\r\ntion (M 5 .93, s.d. 5 .06) performed signicantly better\r\n\r\nthan participants in the novel task condition (M 5 .75,\r\ns.d. 5 .17), F (1, 31) 5 7.48, p , .01, (h\r\n2 5 .19).\r\nThere was also a signicant main effect of audience, F\r\n(2, 31) 5 3.71, p , .05, (h\r\n\r\n2 5 .19). Results of planned\r\ncontrasts revealed that participants performed signi-\r\ncantly worse across both tasks (that is, well-learned and\r\nnovel) in the presence of the avatar observers (M 5 .77,\r\ns.d. 5 .21) compared to when they performed in the\r\npresence of the agent observers (M 5 .89, s.d. 5 .08),\r\np , .05. Moreover, participants performed marginally\r\n\r\nworse when performing in front of the two avatar ob-\r\nservers compared to when performing alone (M 5 .85,\r\n\r\ns.d. 5 .15), p , .10.\r\n\r\n5.3.2.2 Hypothesis Testing: Assessing the Social Fa-\r\ncilitation Hypothesis. As can be seen in gure 3, these\r\n\r\nmain effects were qualied, by a signicant audience\r\ntype 3 task type interaction, F (2, 31) 5 3.36, p , .05,\r\n(h\r\n\r\n2 5 .18). To further examine the nature of the inter-\r\naction, we performed simple main effects tests and\r\n\r\nplanned contrasts to compare the three audience condi-\r\ntions within each task type (well-learned or novel). First,\r\n\r\nthe simple main effect of audience type was examined\r\n\r\n2. The possible range of scores for both the task novelty and task\r\nanxiety subscales was 2 to 14.\r\n3. The possible range of scores for the copresence subscale was 7\r\nto 49.\r\n4. We also did not include sex as a factor in subsequent analyses\r\ndue to the small sample size.\r\n5. The pattern of results without including task anxiety and task\r\nnovelty as covariates is identical, although the task type 3 audience\r\ninteraction is only marginally signicant (p , .10).\r\n\r\nFigure 3. Mean task performance as a function of audience type\r\n(avatar or agent or no audience) and task type (well-learned or\r\nnovel). Bars with different letters indicate that the means differ\r\nsignicantly at the p , .05 level.\r\n\r\n190 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\nwithin the well-learned task condition to test for the\r\nsocial facilitation effect. We had hypothesized that those\r\n\r\nparticipants performing a well-learned task in the pres-\r\nence of avatar observers would perform signicantly bet-\r\nter than those performing either alone or in the pres-\r\nence of agent observers. Contrary to our hypothesis,\r\n\r\nhowever, the results of this analysis revealed that there\r\nwere no signicant differences in performance across the\r\nthree audience types, F , 1.\r\n\r\nThis nding was not completely unexpected, how-\r\never, as it most likely reects a ceiling effect associated\r\n\r\nwith the well-learned task. Specically, because partici-\r\npants were required to learn the rst task to an 80% cri-\r\nterion, there was little room for improvement in the\r\n\r\nwell-learned task condition. Once participants learned\r\nthe appropriate categorization strategy in the learning\r\nphase, there was very little variability in their scores in\r\n\r\nthe testing phase. (See Bond and Titus’ 1983 meta-\r\nanalysis of social facilitation research for an explication\r\n\r\nand review of this problem in social facilitation re-\r\nsearch.)\r\n\r\n5.3.2.3 Hypothesis Testing: Assessing the Social Inhi-\r\nbition Hypothesis. Next, the simple main effect of audi-\r\nence condition was examined within the novel task con-\r\ndition to test for the social inhibition effect. We had\r\n\r\nhypothesized that those participants performing a novel\r\ntask in the presence of avatar observers would perform\r\n\r\nsignicantly worse than those performing either alone\r\nor in the presence of agent observers. As predicted,\r\nthere was a signicant simple main effect of audience\r\ncondition, F (2, 31) 5 7.01, p , .01, (h\r\n2 5 .31),\r\nwithin the novel task condition. Specically, planned\r\ncontrasts comparing the three audience types revealed\r\nthat participants performing in the presence of the two\r\n\r\navatar observers (M 5 .62, s.d. 5 .20) performed signif-\r\nicantly worse than did participants performing either in\r\n\r\nthe presence of the two agent observers (M 5 .84, s.d. 5 .05) or alone (M 5 .78, s.d. 5 .18), ps , .05. As ex-\r\npected, however, the difference in performance between\r\n\r\nparticipants in the agent and no audience (that is, alone)\r\nconditions was not statistically signicant.\r\n\r\n5.3.3 Mediational Analyses. To test the hy-\r\npothesis that copresence would at least partially mediate\r\n\r\nthe relationship between perceived agency (that is,\r\nwhether the audience was composed of avatars or\r\nagents) and task performance, a mediational analysis was\r\nconducted within the novel task condition (because that\r\nwas the condition in which social inhibition was found).\r\nFollowing Baron and Kenny’s (1986) procedures, the\r\ndirect relationship between perceived agency and task\r\nperformance was rst assessed. As can be seen in gure\r\n\r\n4, there was a strong, negative association between per-\r\nceived agency and task performance indicating that per-\r\nformance within the novel task condition was signi-\r\n\r\nFigure 4. Copresence as a mediator of the relationship between perceived agency and task\r\nperformance within the novel task condition. Path coefcients are standardized regression coefcients\r\n(b) and coefcients in parentheses indicate nonmediated (direct) effects.\r\n\r\nHoyt et al. 191\r\n\r\ncantly worse in the avatar audience condition than in\r\nthe agent audience condition, R\r\n\r\n2 5 .43, F (1, 12) 5\r\n\r\n9.12, p , .05.\r\nSecond, the association between perceived agency\r\n\r\nand copresence was assessed. Results of a standard re-\r\ngression analysis indicated that perceived agency was\r\n\r\nsignicantly, positively associated with copresence, indi-\r\ncating that participants in the avatar audience condition\r\n\r\nexperienced signicantly greater copresence than did\r\nthose in the agent condition, R\r\n\r\n2 5 .71, F (1, 12) 5\r\n29.63, p , .001. The standardized path coefcient (b)\r\nis shown in gure 4.\r\nBecause the initial criteria for establishing mediation\r\nwere met (that is, the predictor variable was signicantly\r\nrelated to both the outcome variable and the mediator),\r\ntask performance was then regressed on perceived\r\nagency and copresence. The results of this analysis were\r\nconsistent with a mediational hypothesis. Specically,\r\ncopresence appeared to fully mediate the relationship\r\nbetween perceived agency and task performance (as re-\r\nected by the perceived agency, task performance path\r\ncoefcient being reduced to the point where it was no\r\nlonger signicantly different from zero). Moreover, the\r\nstandardized path coefcient between copresence and\r\ntask performance was signicantly different from zero,\r\neven when controlling for the effects of the perceived\r\nagency manipulation. Overall, the model was statistically\r\nsignicant, and it accounted for a signicant proportion\r\nof the variance in task performance, R\r\n\r\n2 5 .68, F (2,\r\n\r\n11) 5 11.80, p , .01.\r\n\r\n6 Discussion\r\nImmersive virtual environment technology has\r\ngreat potential for scholars and researchers in a variety\r\nof elds (Blascovich, 2002; Blascovich et al., 2002;\r\nLoomis, Blascovich, & Beall, 1999; Valente & Bardini,\r\n1995). The experiment reported here increases our con-\r\ndence in the technology’s utility for the study of social\r\ninuence. Indeed, we successfully replicated the social\r\ninhibition effect within an IVE. In addition, we found\r\nthat the greater the sense of copresence users reported\r\nexperiencing within the virtual environment, the more\r\n\r\nthe presence of others inuenced their behavior. Finally,\r\n\r\nwe found that copresence fully mediated the relation-\r\nship between perceived agency (that is, whether partici-\r\npants thought the virtual observers were avatars or\r\n\r\nagents) and participants’ performance on a novel task.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, ceiling effects prevented us from de-\r\ntecting social facilitation (such as performance enhance-\r\nment on a well-learned task while performing in the\r\n\r\npresence of others) in this study. That is, contrary to\r\nour hypothesis, participants performing a well-learned\r\ntask in front of an audience of avatars did not perform\r\nsignicantly better than did those performing alone or\r\n\r\nin the presence of an audience of agents. Further re-\r\nsearch will need to determine the exact nature of perfor-\r\nmance enhancement effects in IVEs, perhaps using a\r\n\r\ndifferent kind of task or employing a different learning\r\ncriterion whereby ceiling effects are less likely to occur.\r\nAs hypothesized, social inhibition did not occur when\r\nparticipants performed a novel task in the presence of\r\nagents, but it did occur when participants performed in\r\n\r\nfront of an audience of avatars. Our results are consis-\r\ntent with prior interpretations of social inhibition. Spe-\r\ncically, the replication of social inhibition in the pres-\r\nence of avatars, and not in the presence of agents, can\r\n\r\nbe explained by the evaluative nature of the two types of\r\nobservers. That is, the agents may have been construed\r\nas non-evaluative and the avatars may have been viewed\r\nas evaluative. Thus, in accordance with the evaluation\r\napprehension hypothesis of social inhibition, the dearth\r\n\r\nof social inhibition effects when performing in the pres-\r\nence of agents stems from the notion that they are non-\r\nevaluative (Cottrell et al., 1968).\r\n\r\n6 .1 Design Implicat ions: An\r\nEx aminat ion of Audience Type, Response Type, and Realism\r\n\r\nThe results of this study, along with others re-\r\ncently conducted by social psychologists (Bailenson et\r\n\r\nal., 2002; Bailenson et al., 2001; Swinth & Blascovich,\r\n\r\n2001), demonstrate that many of the basic social pro-\r\ncesses that are observed in nonmediated human-human\r\n\r\ninteractions also occur within virtual environments. This\r\nnding gives us greater condence that multiuser virtual\r\n\r\n192 PRESENCE: VOLUME 12, NUMBER 2\r\n\r\nenvironments can be used successfully for collaboration,\r\ntraining, and education because the ensuing interactions\r\n\r\nappear to be governed by many of the same social dy-\r\nnamics as face-to-face interactions.\r\n\r\nHowever, these results also suggest that, contrary to\r\nwhat has been proposed by some researchers (such as\r\nReeves & Nass, 1996), people do not always respond to\r\nhuman-like agents as they would to other real people.\r\nAlthough we have discussed elsewhere the situations\r\nwhen we believe human-human and human-computer\r\ninteractions are most likely to differ (Blascovich et al.,\r\n\r\n2002; Blascovich, 2002), one of the factors that is im-\r\nportant to consider is the type of response one wishes to\r\n\r\nassess. With low-level, automatic, responses (such as\r\nmaintaining appropriate interpersonal distance), one’s\r\nbeliefs about whether one is interacting with an agent or\r\nan avatar appears not to matter very much. However,\r\nwhen dealing with higher-level, controlled processes\r\n(such as was the case in this study of social inhibition),\r\none’s beliefs about whether one is interacting with an\r\nagent or an avatar appears to matter a great deal.\r\nAs we have also argued elsewhere (Blascovich, 2002;\r\nBlascovich et al., 2002), when users believe they are\r\ninteracting with agents rather than avatars, some level of\r\n\r\nrealism (most importantly, social or interactional real-\r\nism) is necessary for social inuence and meaningful\r\n\r\nsocial interaction to occur. Moreover, the amount of\r\nrealism required is a function of the level of behavior\r\none wishes to assess, with greater realism required for\r\nhigher-level behaviors. In interactions involving avatars,\r\nhowever, realism appears not to matter as much because\r\n\r\nthe mere belief that one is interacting with another per-\r\nson may be sufcient to induce thoughts, feelings, and\r\n\r\nbehaviors that are characteristic of typical human-hu-\r\nman interactions (Bailenson et al, 2001; Swinth & Blas-\r\ncovich, 2001).\r\n\r\nIn this study, for example, we examined fairly high-\r\nlevel social behaviors. According to one explanation of\r\n\r\nsocial inhibition, the decreased performance observed\r\nwhen someone performs a novel task in the presence of\r\n\r\nothers is caused by evaluation apprehension. In the ex-\r\nperiment reported here, we purposefully maintained a\r\n\r\nlow level of realism for our virtual characters because we\r\nwanted to observe the independent effect of audience\r\n\r\ntype (agents or avatars) on their performance and per-\r\nceptions of those virtual characters. In doing so, we\r\n\r\nfound that social inhibition was only observed when\r\nindividuals performed in front of virtual characters that\r\nthey believed represented other real people rather than\r\nwhen they thought they were merely agents, probably\r\nbecause they did not view the agents as evaluative in\r\nthis study.\r\n\r\nRecently, however, Pertaub et al. (2002) demon-\r\nstrated that enhancing the realism of agents can lead to\r\n\r\nsocial inuence, even for high-level responses such as\r\n\r\nthe induction of social anxiety and fear of public speak-\r\ning. Pertaub et al. examined the anxiety responses of\r\n\r\npeople giving a ve-minute presentation to an audience\r\n\r\nof eight agents. They found that, even though partici-\r\npants knew they were speaking in front of an audience\r\n\r\nof agents, those who performed in front of the highly\r\n\r\nrealistic, negative audience exhibited high levels of anxi-\r\nety and self-reported somatic symptoms. One explana-\r\ntion for this nding is that the negative audience ap-\r\npeared highly evaluative, and thus performance on a\r\n\r\ndifcult task was impaired even though the audience\r\nwas composed solely of agents.\r\nOverall, the results from this research have numerous\r\nimplications for those who design and use multiuser\r\n\r\nvirtual environments for research, training, collabora-\r\ntion, entertainment, and other purposes. We suggest\r\n\r\nthat VE designers should engage in a cost-benet analy-\r\nsis when designing a VE to determine the level of real-\r\nism that is necessary. Specically, we propose that\r\n\r\nrealism is most important in VEs supporting social\r\ninteraction with agents, especially when one wishes to\r\ninuence or assess higher-level responses. In sum,\r\ndesigners should consider whether users will interact\r\nwith agents or avatars and the types of interaction likely\r\n\r\nto occur when developing multiuser virtual environ-\r\nments.\r\n\r\n6 .2 Limitat ions and Suggest ions for\r\nFuture Research\r\nUnfortunately, there is a potential but unlikely\r\n\r\nconfound in this study that should be explored by fu-\r\nture research. Specically, the effect of having the re-\r\nHoyt et al. 193\r\n\r\nsearch assistants physically present in the experimental\r\n\r\nroom in the avatar audience condition needs to be de-\r\ntermined by running control conditions in which there\r\n\r\nare real people present in the experimental room but\r\nnot in the IVE and in which there are avatars present in\r\n\r\nthe IVE but no real people physically present in the ex-\r\nperimental room. However, the results from other re-\r\nsearch (Bailenson et al., in press; Bailenson et al., 2001;\r\n\r\nSwinth & Blascovich, 2001) suggest that one’s belief\r\nthat one is in the presence of an avatar is sufcient to\r\ninduce social inuence. For example, Swinth and\r\nBlascovich found that individuals demonstrate greater\r\nconformity when they think that they are interacting\r\nwith avatars compared to when they think they are\r\ninteracting with agents, even when they are in reality\r\ninteracting with agents and no people are physically\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nBecause immersive virtual environments that can si-\r\nmultaneously be shared by real and virtual people pro-\r\nvide great promise for communications, collaboration,\r\n\r\ncultural exchange, and social research, the issue of social\r\ninteraction in immersive virtual environments has come\r\ninto prominence. Hopefully, with the vested interest of\r\nvarious researchers and entrepreneurs, we can rapidly\r\ndevelop a clear understanding of the elements of social\r\n\r\nrelations within a virtual environment. Once the neces-\r\nsary and sufcient conditions of the phenomenological\r\n\r\nexperience of others in a virtual world have been identi-\r\ned, new chapters in both virtual environmental and\r\nexperimental social psychological theory and research\r\nwill be opened.\r\n\r\nAck nowledgment s\r\nThis work was supported by grants from the National Science\r\nFoundation (SBR-9872084 and SBR-9873432) to the second\r\nauthor.');

How does this affect\r\n\r\nfuture interface designers? We replicated classical tests of\r\nsocial influence known as the social facilitation and\r\ninhibition effects. Social facilitation/inhibition theory states\r\nthat when in the presence of others, people perform simple\r\ntasks better and complex tasks worse. Participants were\r\nrandomly assigned to perform both simple and complex\r\ntasks alone and in the presence of either a real human, a\r\n\r\nprojected virtual human, or a virtual human in a head-\r\nmounted display.

Maes [15]\r\ndescribes interface agents as:\r\n“Instead of user-initiated interaction via commands\r\n\r\nand/or direct manipulation, the user is engaged in a co-\r\noperative process in which human and computer agents\r\n\r\nboth initiate communication, monitor events and\r\nperform tasks. The metaphor used is that of a personal\r\nassistant who is collaborating with the user in the same\r\nwork environment.”\r\nWith the emergence of interface agents [16] and virtual\r\ncharacters in everyday applications, understanding how\r\npeople respond to interface agents is crucial. One way to\r\nexamine peoples’ responses to agents and avatars in a social\r\nsetting is to look at social psychology literature.\r\nIn social psychology literature, one of the classical tests that\r\nshow how the presence of others affects task performance is\r\nsocial facilitation/inhibition [29, 6, 25]. Social\r\nfacilitation/inhibition refers to performance enhancement of\r\na simple or well learned task, and performance impairment\r\nof a complex or novel task, when completed in the presence\r\nof others. Zajonc suggests that this phenomenon is due to\r\nthe facilitation of dominant responses that occurs under\r\nincreased physiological arousal [29]. When a person\r\nperforms a task in the presence of an audience,\r\nphysiological arousal occurs, facilitating whatever happens\r\n\r\nto be their dominant response. When a task is easy or well-\r\nlearned (e.g., simple math problems, such as “Is 2 + 2 =\r\n\r\n4?”), the dominant response to the task is likely to be the\r\ncorrect response, thus the presence of others facilitates\r\nperformance on these tasks. Conversely, when a task is\r\nnovel or difficult (e.g., complex math problems), the correct\r\nresponse is typically not the dominant response; therefore\r\nan increased dominant response will impair, rather than\r\nfacilitate performance on these tasks. Although most social\r\npsychologists are in agreement that social\r\nfacilitation/inhibition effects are due to the increased\r\narousal that occurs in the presence of an audience, much\r\ndebate has ensued over the specific cause of this arousal.\r\nSome researchers suggest that these effects result from the\r\n\r\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\r\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\r\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies\r\nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.

Whereas, Zajonc maintains that the mere\r\npresence of others (even in the absence of evaluation) is\r\nenough to create physiological arousal [29]; he suggests\r\nthat this response stems from evolutionarily adaptive\r\ntendencies to remain vigilant and alert in the presence of\r\nothers. Others suggest that this phenomenon is simply due\r\nto the fact that an audience distracts attention from the task\r\nat hand [2]. In support of this, researchers have found\r\nsimilar facilitation and inhibition effects to occur in\r\nresponse to “nonsocial” distractions, such as loud bursts of\r\nnoise or lights.\r\nThe present study examines if this theory from social\r\npsychology carries over to interacting with virtual humans\r\nor agents in the context of social facilitation/inhibition.\r\nDirectly comparing the results of human-human interaction\r\nwith human-virtual human interaction may result in a better\r\nunderstanding of social responses to virtual human\r\ninterfaces and lead to improved interface design.\r\nRELATED WORK\r\nSocial Facilitation and Inhibition\r\nTriplett’s first investigation of social influence in 1898 led\r\nto the development of many social facilitation theories and\r\nstudies [25]. These social facilitation theories include\r\nZajonc’s drive theory [29], Cottrell, Wack, Sekerak, and\r\nRittle’s socialization theory [8], and Sanders, Baron and\r\nMoore’s [22] attentional conflict theory. Numerous studies\r\nhave been conducted to test the effect of the presence of\r\nothers on task performance; Bond and Titus performed a\r\nmeta-analysis of 241 social facilitation studies and\r\nsummarized the results of these studies [6].\r\nIn a more recent study, Blascovich et al. conducted an\r\nexperiment on social facilitation based on the\r\nbiopsychosocial model of challenge and threat [5]. This\r\nmodel states that in goal-relevant situations involving\r\naffective and cognitive processes, challenge occurs when\r\nthe resources from individual experiences meet demands of\r\nthe situation, whereas for threat, these resources are\r\ninsufficient to meet demands. In the experiment, the authors\r\nmeasured cardiovascular responses of participants while\r\nthey either performed a novel or well-learned task alone or\r\nin the presence of others. They found that participants\r\nperforming the well-learned task in the presence of others\r\nhad an increased cardiac response and decreased vascular\r\nresistance, whereas participants performing a novel-learned\r\ntask in the presence of others had an increased cardiac\r\nresponse and increased vascular resistance. Both of which\r\nfit the challenge and threat model. Participants performing\r\nthe task alone, learned or unlearned, demonstrated no\r\nappreciable reactivity from baseline.\r\nHoyt et al. assessed the utility of using immersive virtual\r\nenvironment technology for social psychological research\r\n[12]. Participants mastered one of two tasks and\r\nsubsequently performed the mastered or non-mastered task\r\n\r\neither alone or in the presence of a virtual human audience\r\n\r\nwhom they were led to believe were either computer-\r\ncontrolled agents or human-controlled avatars. The authors\r\n\r\nfound that participants performing in the presence of\r\navatars demonstrated classic social inhibition performance\r\nimpairment effects relative to those performing alone or in\r\nthe presence of agents. However, this study introduced a\r\npossible confound by having the research assistants\r\nphysically present in the experimental room in the avatar\r\naudience condition. Additionally, the research data did not\r\nstrongly indicate the effect of audience.\r\nRickenberg and Reeves ran an experiment to test the effects\r\nof different animated character presentation on user anxiety,\r\ntask performance, and subjective evaluations of two\r\ncommerce Web sites [21]. They found that the effects of\r\nmonitoring and individual differences in the way a person\r\nthinks about control worked as they do in real life. Users\r\nfelt more anxious when characters monitored their Web site\r\nwork and this effect was strongest for users with an external\r\ncontrol orientation. Monitoring characters also decreased\r\ntask performance, but increased trust in Web site content. In\r\nthe present study, we are interested in directly comparing\r\npeople’s responses to a virtual human with their responses\r\nto a real human. In addition, we are interested in doing this\r\nin the context of social psychology to examine how social\r\ninteractions between people map to social interaction with\r\nvirtual humans.\r\nWe have previously conducted a study which attempted to\r\nreplicate the social facilitation/social inhibition effects [28].\r\nParticipants first learned a task and were then randomly\r\nassigned to perform the same or a novel task either alone, in\r\nthe presence of a real human, or in the presence of a virtual\r\nhuman. Although the results of the study showed that\r\npeople reacted to the virtual human similarly to the way\r\nthey reacted to the real human, our results did not indicate a\r\nstrong effect and we were able to replicate the inhibition\r\neffect with females only. In addition, we found that more\r\nwomen learned the novel task when alone than when being\r\nobserved by either a human or a virtual human. However, it\r\nseemed that male participants were not affected by the\r\npresence of an audience, both in terms of inhibition and\r\nfacilitation. We believe that the weak results from the\r\nprevious study were largely due to the pattern recognition\r\nand number categorization tasks that were used to produce\r\nthe social inhibition and facilitation effects. Student\r\nreactions were variable and a number of participants did not\r\nunderstand the task.\r\nOur current study uses a more well-defined task and a more\r\nsensitive experimental design. We chose a task that varied\r\ndifficulty by using simple and complex math problems. We\r\nhad evidence that verified the difficulty levels of the items\r\nfrom previous studies with the same student population [9].\r\nUsing math problems also eliminates the need for a training\r\nphase where participants are required to learn a task.\r\nEliminating the training phase allowed us to treat audience\r\n\r\n(alone or in the presence of another) as a within subjects\r\nvariable.\r\nInterface Agents\r\nReeves and Nass have shown through several studies that\r\npeople interact, treat, and identify with computers and\r\nsoftware agents based on perceived, human characteristics,\r\nsuch as the computer’s helpfulness, expertise, and\r\nfriendliness [20].\r\nA recent trend in computer interfaces has been to include\r\nagents or avatars in an attempt to enhance the user\r\nexperience. Koda and Maes [14] argue that employing a\r\nface as the representation of an agent is engaging, makes a\r\nuser pay more attention, and takes more effort for a user to\r\ninteract with the system. They also found that realistic faces\r\nwere better liked and rated more intelligent than abstract\r\nfaces by the users.\r\nParise et al., investigated how cooperation with a computer\r\nagent was affected by the agent\'s pictorial realism and\r\nhuman likeness. Participants played a game with a talking\r\ncomputer agent that resembled a person, a real dog, a\r\ncartoon dog, or with a confederate through a video link.\r\nThey found that participants cooperated highly with the\r\nagent resembling a person and the confederate. Although\r\nparticipants loved the dog and dog cartoon agents, they\r\ncooperated significantly less with the dog agents [18].\r\nBaylor et al., investigated the impact of interface agent\r\nappearance (age, gender, “coolness”) on enhancing\r\nundergraduate females’ attitudes toward engineering [4].\r\nThey found that females reported more positive stereotypes\r\nof engineers after interacting with a female agent, but\r\nreported that engineering was more useful and engaging\r\nwhen interacting with a male agent. Age interacted with\r\n“coolness” such that young cool agents were more effective\r\nthan young uncool agents, whereas old uncool agents were\r\nmore effective than old cool agents. In another study,\r\nBaylor investigated the impact of a pedagogical agent’s\r\ngender, realism, and ethnicity on affective and motivational\r\noutcomes [3]. The results suggest a need to consider\r\nindividual differences in learning with social interfaces.\r\nThese studies focus on how the appearance of computer\r\nagents affects cooperation, changing attitudes, and\r\nmotivating users. In the present study, we are interested in\r\nhow the mere presence of such an agent might influence\r\ntask performance. Having an ever-present computer agent,\r\ndespite its appearance, might have some unexpected results\r\non the user’s task performance.\r\nVirtual Humans\r\nVirtual humans have previously been used in the context of\r\nsocial psychology. Slater, et al., conducted studies on the\r\neffects and social ramifications of having avatars in virtual\r\nenvironments [24]. They were able to elicit emotions such\r\nas embarrassment, irritation, and self-awareness in virtual\r\nmeetings; and they found that the presence of avatars was\r\n\r\nimportant for social interaction, task performance, and\r\npresence [24].\r\nIn a previous study, we examined the roles of gender and\r\nvisual realism in the persuasiveness of speakers [26].\r\nParticipants were presented with a persuasive passage\r\ndelivered by a male or female person, virtual human, or\r\nvirtual character. They were then assessed on attitude\r\nchange and their ratings of the argument, message, and\r\nspeaker. The results indicated that the virtual speakers were\r\nas effective at changing attitudes as real people. Male\r\nparticipants were more persuaded when the speaker was\r\nfemale than when the speaker was male, whereas female\r\nparticipants were more persuaded when the speaker was\r\nmale than when the speaker was female. In addition, ratings\r\nof the perceptions of the speaker were more favorable for\r\nvirtual speakers than for human speakers.\r\nVirtual humans are also being used to improve the\r\neffectiveness of an Educational Virtual World (EVW) that\r\nincorporates different presentation techniques in the\r\nPresentation of Education and Training Subjects (PETS)\r\nsystem [7]. The virtual human provides both pedagogical\r\nand navigational assistance, and can be tailored to the needs\r\nand preferences of the learner.\r\nResearchers have even proposed the use of virtual humans\r\nto help children with learning disabilities. In a system\r\nnamed “Buddy”, a virtual child acts as a virtual friend for\r\nautistic children with a hidden eye tracker and camera to\r\ntrain a child’s social attention by reinforcing gaze behavior\r\nand encourages the child to look at the animated face’s\r\ninformative area [19]. Virtual humans have also been used\r\nby medical students to practice patient interviewing skills\r\nusing natural methods of interaction with a high level of\r\nimmersion [13].\r\nIn all of these applications virtual humans are meant to aid\r\nthe user in some way, training, teaching, or even acting as a\r\nfriend. There is an underlying assumption that the virtual\r\nhuman will only have a positive effect on the user. It is\r\ntherefore important to fully understand how people\r\nresponse to virtual humans in these social settings. By\r\nreplicating one of the classical tests of social influence with\r\na virtual human, we hope that the present study will shed\r\nsome light on this subject.\r\nEXPERIMENTAL STUDY\r\nBuilding on the lessons learned from our first experiment\r\nwith social facilitation and inhibition [28], we have\r\ndesigned a follow-up study that uses simple and complex\r\ntasks rather than learned and novel tasks. Simple and\r\ncomplex math tasks were chosen because they eliminated\r\nthe need for a training phase (since we can assume that all\r\ncollege students have some basic math skills); and allowed\r\nus to treat task type as a within-subject rather than a\r\nbetween-subject variable. That is, all participants performed\r\nboth the simple and complex tasks for this experiment. In\r\naddition, we were interested in how the level of immersion\r\n\r\nmight influence the results. We compared participants’\r\nreactions to a real and virtual human and included a fully\r\nimmersive condition using a head mounted display (HMD)\r\nsuch that the user is fully immersed in an environment\r\nwhere the virtual human appears in three dimensions.\r\nSocial facilitation/inhibition theory simply states that\r\npeople perform simple tasks better when in the presence of\r\nothers, and complex tasks worse. For this experiment, we\r\nhypothesized that participants’ reactions to the presence of\r\nthe real and virtual human would show social facilitation\r\nand inhibition effects.\r\nSeveral researchers have shown that using an HMD leads to\r\na significantly higher sense of presence in a virtual\r\nenvironment than non-immersive displays [11, 25]. For\r\ninstance, in an experiment on the fear of public speaking,\r\nSlater et al. found that presence tended to amplify\r\nparticipants’ responses to a virtual audience (which was\r\neither positive or negative) [23]. In other words: People\r\nexperiencing a higher level of presence were prone to report\r\nmore negative reactions to a negative audience and more\r\npositive reactions to a positive audience. Given the\r\nexpected higher sense of presence in the immersive\r\ncondition, we believe that participants will experience\r\nhigher levels of facilitation and inhibition in the fully\r\nimmersive virtual human condition than in the projected\r\nvirtual human condition.\r\nParticipants\r\nA total of 85 students (23 males, 62 females, mean age =\r\n23.7, SD = 8.28) from the University of North Carolina at\r\nCharlotte participated in the study. Volunteers were\r\nrecruited from the psychology department subject pool, and\r\nall received credit points towards their psychology class\r\ngrade.\r\nStimulus Materials\r\nBoth simple and complex tasks required the participants to\r\nverify the accuracy of a series of mathematical equations\r\npresented in sentence form. The simple tasks consisted of\r\naddition or subtraction problems with one operation\r\npresented as a yes or no question, “Is 5 + 2 = 7?” The\r\ncomplex consisted of four operations (addition, subtraction,\r\nmultiplication, and division), such as: Is (2 x 3) + (4 / 1) - 5\r\n= 5? The numbers used were integers between 1 and 10.\r\nFor the incorrect examples (such as Is 7 - 3 = 5? Or Is (6/3)\r\n+ 8 - (4 x 2) = 3), the answer was within two values of the\r\ncorrect answer. Participants were required to verify the\r\naccuracy of the statement by making a key press response.\r\nProportion of items answered correctly and the response\r\ntime were used as measures of task performance.\r\nPre experimental questionnaires collected data on\r\nparticipant characteristics (such as age, gender and\r\nethnicity, computer use) and measured math anxiety. The\r\nmath anxiety scale [1] includes 25 items that measure the\r\nparticipants’ level of anxiety by asking them to rate how\r\nanxious different math-related statements make them feel\r\n\r\n(such as “Studying for a math test” or “Watching a teacher\r\nwork on an algebraic equation on the blackboard”). These\r\nitems are assessed on a 5-point Likert scale (1 - Not at all, 2\r\n– A little, 3 – A fair amount, 4 – Much, 5 – Very Much) and\r\nitem responses are summed into a math anxiety score. The\r\nscore was used for screening to make sure that participants\r\nin all conditions are equivalent in advance of the\r\nexperiment. This measure helped determine if there were\r\nany preexisting confounding factors among the different\r\ngroups.\r\nPost experimental questionnaires measured task anxiety and\r\ncopresence. Task anxiety was measured with one item that\r\nasked the participants to rate their level of anxiety on a 7\r\npoint numerical scale (1. not at all to 7. a great deal).\r\nCopresence refers to the participants’ sense of being with\r\nanother person in the second phase of the experiment. The\r\ncopresence questionnaire was adapted from the Slater\r\nCoPresence Questionnaire [17]. Participants used a 7-point\r\nnumerical scale (1. not at all to 7. a great deal) to respond to\r\nseventeen items (such as “I had a sense of being with the\r\nother person....” or “The experience seems to me more like\r\ninteracting with a person...”). Responses to the items were\r\nused to compute two measures: copresence mean and count.\r\nThe copresence mean is the average rating across all of the\r\nitems and the copresence count indicates the number of\r\nresponses that were higher than four.\r\nApparatus\r\nA Pentium IV 2.4 GHz Dell PC with an nVidia GeForce4\r\nTi 4200 graphics card served as the graphics generator for\r\nthe virtual human. The graphics were rendered with\r\nOpenGL then projected using a Sony VPL-CX5 data\r\nprojector.\r\nStimulus presentation and data collection were controlled\r\nby an additional Pentium IV 2.4 GHz Dell PC attached to a\r\n17 inch flatscreen monitor (Figures 1 and 2).\r\nFor the virtual human immersive condition, the participants\r\nused a head mounted display (HMD) (figure 3a). We used a\r\nVirtual Research V8 HMD which has 640 X 480 resolution\r\nin each eye. The HMD contains two small screens about\r\ntwo inches in front of the eyes. A 3rdTech HiBall-3100\r\nTracker was used to track position and orientation. The\r\nstimuli screen and virtual human were rendered in the same\r\nvirtual room. Figure 3b shows the participant’s view of the\r\nvirtual human from the HMD.\r\nWe used one of Haptek Corporation’s interactive 3-D\r\ncharacters for the virtual human [10]. Haptek also has a\r\nlibrary which allowed us to create our own realistic\r\nanimations and behaviors.\r\nThe nature of this experiment requires that the audience,\r\nboth human and virtual, exhibit only non-verbal gestures\r\nand behaviors. In order to make our virtual human, Diana,\r\n\r\nhuman-like, we modeled her actions based on the non-\r\nverbal behaviors of the human audience in this experiment\r\n\r\nand executed them at random. These behaviors included\r\n\r\ncoughing, sniffling, yawning, looking around, clearing\r\nthroat, and shifting in her chair. In addition, Diana displays\r\nlife-like behaviors such as breathing, blinking, and other\r\nsubtle gestures. Two speakers at the bottom of the\r\nprojection screen were used to output the various sounds\r\nfrom Diana (coughing, sniffing, etc.).\r\n\r\nFigure 1.

Participant view of virtual audience in the Virtual\r\n\r\nHuman Immersive condition\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\nPre-Experiment: In the main area of the lab, participants\r\nfilled out the informed consent form and the pre-experiment\r\nquestionnaire. They were then given instructions regarding\r\nthe experimental procedures.\r\nPractice-Session: The participants were taken to the testing\r\nroom where they were instructed on how to perform the\r\ntasks. Specifically, they were told the objective of the tasks,\r\nshown how to use the keyboard to respond, and led through\r\na sample trial for each task to familiarize them with the\r\nprocedures and the tones following the correct and incorrect\r\nresponses.\r\nPhase I: The first phase of the experiment was the alone\r\ncondition which involved completion of the simple and\r\ncomplex math tasks while alone in the room. Each task\r\nincluded 25 math sentences with an equal number of correct\r\nand incorrect problems randomly arranged. Participants\r\nwere escorted to the experiment room to perform these\r\ntasks and were instructed to return to the main area of the\r\nlab when done. The experimenter left the room. After the\r\nparticipants completed phase I, there was a five minute rest\r\nperiod during which the participants received instructions\r\nspecific to their randomly assigned conditions for phase II.\r\nThose assigned to one of the two virtual human audience\r\ncondition were told that during the task they would be\r\njoined by a computer-controlled virtual observer. Those\r\nassigned to the human audience condition were told that\r\nduring the task they would be joined by a female observer.\r\nPhase II: In the human audience condition, the female\r\nobserver was seated in a chair arranged so that she can\r\nobserve the participant and the projection screen. In the\r\nvirtual human projected condition, our virtual human,\r\nDiana, was projected on a screen so that she too can\r\n‘observe’ the participant and the testing screen. In the\r\nvirtual human immersive condition, Diana was displayed in\r\nthe HMD. She was seated behind a virtual desk. Diana\r\n\r\nlooked at the screen and at the participant. Her nonverbal\r\nresponses were intended to indicate some genuine interest\r\nin what the participant was doing.\r\nPost-Experiment: Upon completion of the testing phase,\r\nparticipants returned to the main area of the lab, where they\r\nfilled out a short questionnaire and were debriefed and\r\nthanked for their participation.\r\nThe experiment took approximately half an hour to\r\ncomplete.\r\nDesign\r\nA 3 x 2 x 2 mixed analysis of variance was used to test for\r\nthe main and interaction effects of each of the variables that\r\nare under study\r\n1. Group (Human, Virtual Human Projected,\r\nVirtual Human Immersive)\r\n2. Task type (Simple vs. Complex)\r\n3. Audience condition (Alone vs. Audience)\r\nThe first variable was manipulated between subjects while\r\nthe others were repeated measures. Participants were\r\nrandomly assigned to one of three groups:\r\n1. Human (H)\r\n2. Virtual Human Projected (VHP)\r\n3. Virtual Human Immersive (VHI)\r\nRESULTS\r\nTask Performance Data\r\nAccuracy and response times were automatically recorded\r\nfor each participant on every trial. Task performance data\r\nwere computed by summing the number of correct\r\nresponses across the 25 trials in each condition and\r\nconverting to percentages. Reaction times measured the\r\ntime from the presentation of the math question until the\r\nparticipant’s response. There was no limit set for response\r\ntime. Reaction times were trimmed such that responses that\r\nwere more than two standard deviations from the mean\r\nwere not included in the analysis; 4.9% of the responses\r\nwere eliminated for this reason. Mean reaction times were\r\ncalculated for the remaining responses that were scored as\r\ncorrect.\r\nThe task performance data were treated with a 3 x 2 x 2\r\nANOVA to test for the between subject effect of group\r\n(Human, Virtual Human Projected, Virtual Human\r\nImmersive), and the within subject effects of task type\r\n(Simple vs. Complex) and audience (Alone vs. Audience).\r\nPercent Correct\r\nTable 1 shows the mean percentages for the simple and\r\ncomplex tasks by audience type and group.\r\nAs expected, there was a significant main effect for task\r\ntype, F(1, 82) = 145.66, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.64. Participants\r\nperformed significantly better on the simple task (M =\r\n94.86%) than on the complex task (M = 83.92%).\r\n\r\nThere was a significant main effect of audience, F(1, 82) =\r\n6.86, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.08. Participants performed\r\nsignificantly better alone (M = 90.22%) than in the presence\r\nof an audience (M = 88.56%).\r\nFigure 4 shows the significant interaction effect of task by\r\naudience, F(1, 82) = 10.46, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.11. Participants\r\nperformed slightly better on the simple task when in the\r\npresence of an audience than alone, and much worse on the\r\ncomplex task when in the presence of an audience than\r\nalone (see Table 1 for means).\r\nThere were no performance differences among the groups\r\n(Human, Virtual Human Projected, Virtual Human\r\nImmersive), F(2, 82) = 1.29, p = 0.28; and the group\r\nvariable was not found to interact with any of the other\r\nvariables of interest. There was no interaction effect of task\r\nx audience x group, F(2, 82) = 2.24, p = 0.11; or an\r\ninteraction of task by group, F < 1; or an interaction of\r\naudience by group, F(2, 82) = 2.13, p = 0.13. The task by\r\naudience effect was not found to vary significantly by\r\ngroup. The differences found in performance are due to the\r\ntype of task (simple or complex) and the type of audience\r\n(alone or in the presence of others).\r\n\r\nFigure 4. Task by audience interaction for percent correct\r\n\r\ndata.\r\n\r\nReaction Time\r\nTable 2 shows the mean reaction times in milliseconds for\r\nthe simple and complex tasks by audience type and group.\r\n\r\nAs expected, there was a significant main effect for task\r\ntype, F(1, 82) = 1388.75, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.94. Participants\r\nresponded significantly faster on the simple task (M = 2226\r\nms) than on the complex task (M = 9851 ms).\r\nThe effect of audience was also significant, F(1, 82) = 3.35,\r\np = 0.04, η2 = 0.05. Participants responded slightly faster\r\nalone (M = 5875 ms) than in the presence of an audience (M\r\n= 6202 ms).\r\nFigure 5 shows the significant interaction effect of task by\r\naudience, F(1, 82) = 8.22, p < 0.01, η2 = 0.09. Participants\r\nresponded slightly faster on the simple task when in the\r\npresence of an audience than alone, and much slower on the\r\ncomplex task when in the presence of an audience than\r\nalone (see Table 2 for means). This result mirrors the result\r\nfor the per cent correct data.

The\r\nmain effect of group was not significant, χ\r\n2\r\n(48) =\r\n\r\n45.10, p=0.59.\r\n When asked: “What percentage of the time did you\r\nfeel that you were being watched by another\r\nperson?” The mean response of the participants in\r\nthe human condition was 49.6% (SD = 50.3),\r\n50.9% in the virtual human projected condition\r\n\r\n(SD = 43.5), and 47.1% in the virtual human\r\nimmersive condition (SD = 48.7).

There were\r\nno significant differences among the groups on any of these\r\nmeasures, Fs < 1.\r\nIn addition, only the math anxiety scores correlated\r\nsignificantly with the percent correct data, p < 0.01. No\r\n\r\nother correlations were found between these variables and\r\nthe task performance data.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis study found that participants were inhibited while\r\nperforming complex math problems when in the presence\r\nof a human, virtual human projected life-size, and a virtual\r\nhuman in an immersive virtual environment. The type of\r\naudience present was not a factor, just that there was an\r\naudience present. The theory of social inhibition carries\r\nover to the virtual human in this study.\r\nBoth percent correct data and reaction time data worked in\r\nparallel in indicating an inhibition effect. Participants not\r\nonly performed worse in terms of percent correct while in\r\nthe presence of others on the complex task, but they also\r\nperformed much slower.\r\nWe were unable to replicate the facilitation effect whereby\r\npeople perform simple tasks better when in the presence of\r\nothers. Most likely because of a ceiling effect with the\r\nsimple math problems, this is a common problem in social\r\nfacilitation research [6]. Although both the percent correct\r\nand reaction time data show trends towards a facilitation\r\neffect, the results were not strong enough to claim a\r\nfacilitation effect.\r\nThe immersive condition was expected to lead the highest\r\nlevel of inhibition because of the heightened feeling of\r\npresence. This was not the case however; we believe that\r\nthis may have been due to a problem with the lack of\r\nperipheral vision in an HMD (60 degrees diagonal field of\r\nview). The nature of the facilitation/inhibition effects are\r\nsuch that you have someone (in your peripheral vision)\r\nwatching over you while performing task. However, in an\r\nHMD, it is possible to block out the view by turning your\r\nhead. Further research is required to investigate whether\r\nthis was due to peripheral vision.\r\nThe results from this study have implications for future\r\ndesigners of interfaces employing a virtual human. It is\r\ncrucial for interface designers to understand how people\r\nrespond and interact with these virtual human interfaces.\r\nThe results from this study show that virtual humans can\r\nindeed inhibit a person while performing a complex task.\r\nThis should be taken into account when considering a\r\nvirtual human interface that is intended to aid or facilitate a\r\nuser in accomplishing a complex or novel task. Designers\r\nmust be careful that the virtual human interface does not\r\ninhibit rather than facilitate the user!\r\nThe results from this study, as well as others [20, 21, 26],\r\nindicate that many of the rules that apply in human-human\r\ninteraction carry over to interacting with interface agents\r\nand computers. Designers should consider human social\r\ninteraction theories in developing interface agents.\r\nLIMITATIONS OF THIS WORK\r\nThe results of this study are limited to the virtual character\r\nemployed in our experiment and may not generalize to\r\n\r\nother types of virtual characters. Further research is needed\r\nthat examine a larger variety of virtual characters.\r\nAnother drawback was the uneven number of male and\r\nfemale participants who were available for the study. More\r\nmale participants are needed to fully examine the gender\r\neffects.\r\nFinally, to achieve more generalizable findings, this study\r\nshould be replicated with a sample that includes more\r\ndiverse groups of people, not just college students.\r\nFUTURE WORK\r\nThere are a number of remaining questions that could be\r\nanswered with further research. One of our future goals is\r\nto examine possible cross gender interactions by adding a\r\nmale observer as well as more male participants.\r\nAnother future goal is to track the head movements of the\r\nparticipants in the HMD condition. We suspect that the\r\nproblem of lack of peripheral vision in an HMD made have\r\ncontributed to the results from that condition. Tracking and\r\nlogging the head movements of the participants will allow\r\nus to visualize and analyze exactly where the participants\r\nwere looking during the experiment. In addition, to increase\r\nparticipants’ peripheral vision, we can use an HMD with a\r\nhigher field of view.\r\nWe are also interested in the effect of the appearance of the\r\nvirtual human. What if the virtual human’s ethnicity as well\r\nas gender matched that of the participant? Future work\r\nshould manipulate the virtual human’s age, gender, as well\r\nas ethnicity.\r\nFinally, since level of immersion was not a factor in\r\nenhancing social influence, future work should explore the\r\neffectiveness of simply having the virtual character as part\r\nof a desktop display.\r\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\nThe authors would like to thank Sabarish Babu for\r\nproviding code for rending the virtual human for the\r\nimmersive condition. The authors would also like to thank\r\nDr. Heather Richter for her advice and feedback in revising\r\nthis document. Finally, we would like to thank all the\r\nparticipants who took part in this study.'),

Thirty-four participants diagnosed with eating disorders were evaluated and treated. The clinical improvement was analyzed from statistical and clinical points of view. Results showed that the patients who received the component for body image treatment improved more than the group without this component. Furthermore, improvement was maintained in post-treatment and at one year follow-up. The results reveal the advantage of including a treatment component addressing body image disturbances in the protocol for general treatment of eating disorders.

McGUIRE\r\n\r\nBackground Virtual reality provides a means of studying paranoid thinking in controlled laboratory conditions.\r\nHowever, this method has not been used with a clinical group.\r\n\r\nAims To establish the feasibility and safety of using virtual reality methodology in people with an at-risk mental state and to investigate the applicability of a cognitive model of paranoia to this group.\r\n\r\nMethod Twenty-one participants with an at-risk mental state were assessed before and after entering a virtual reality environment depicting the inside of an underground train.\r\n\r\nResults Virtual reality did not raise levels of distress at the time of testing or cause adverse experiences over the subsequent week.Individuals attributed mental states to virtual reality characters including hostile intent. Persecutory ideation in virtual reality was predicted by higher levels of trait paranoia, anxiety, stress, immersion in virtual reality, perseveration and interpersonal sensitivity.\r\n\r\nConclusions Virtual reality is an acceptable experimental technique for use with individuals with at-risk mental states. Paranoia in virtual reality was understandable in terms of the cognitive model of persecutory delusions.\r\nDeclaration of interest None.\r\n\r\nRecent research has shown that it is feasible to use virtual reality (VR) to study persecutory ideation under controlled experimental conditions (Freeman et al, 2003, 2005). In these studies psychological variables identi- fied from a cognitive model of persecutory delusions (Garety et al,  2001; Freeman et  al, 2002) have been used to predict the occurrence  of  persecutory  thoughts about\r\ncomputer characters in a neutral virtual reality social environment. The advantage of this controlled experimental approach  is that stimuli can be controlled and any persecutory ideation that occurs is known to be unfounded and hostility cannot be provoked by the participant. In the future, such virtual environments  may  be  used not only to learn about the causes of para- noia but as an element of treatment, as has occurred for anxiety disorders (Krijn et al,\r\n2004). The present study was designed to test whether this innovative experimental technique  is  safe to  use with individuals  at\r\nrisk of psychosis, and could be used to in-\r\nvestigate cognitive models of psychosis in this group. We expected that virtual reality would be safe and acceptable in this group, and   predicted  that   neutral  behaviour  by computer-generated characters in a  typical social setting would be able to induce persecutory thoughts in participants  with  an at-risk mental state. We then tested the hypothesis that the development of persecutory thoughts in these conditions would be associated with factors implicated in cognitive models of persecutory delusions (Garety et al, 2001; Freeman et al, 2002). As far as is known this is the first test of the virtual reality procedure with a clinical group.\r\n\r\nMETHOD\r\nThe design closely followed that developed in previous studies with non-clinical participants (Freeman et al, 2003, 2005). Participants completed a number of assessments before entering a virtual environment. Immediately after leaving this environment, post-virtual reality assessments were administered. In addition, there was a further follow-up assessment after 1 week to deter- mine whether there had been any adverse reactions to the procedure.\r\nThere were 21 participants recruited via Outreach and Support in South London (OASIS), a  specialised  service  for  people at high risk of psychosis (Broome et al, 2005b). All participants were aged between 16 and 35 years, had never experienced a psychotic episode, and were being managed clinically by OASIS in the community. Briefly, participants met one or more  of the following criteria, assessed with a detailed clinical assessment using the Comprehensive Assessment of the At-Risk Mental State (CAARMS; Phillips et al, 2000): (a) attenuated positive psychotic symptoms; (b) brief limited intermittent psychosis (BLIP); or (c) a recent decline in functioning, together with either  schizo- typal personality disorder or a first-degree relative with a psychotic disorder.\r\n\r\nVirtual reality environment\r\n\r\nThe virtual environment was a tube train ride developed by a team at University College London. The environment was modelled on the interior of a London Underground train carriage, and was dis- played in colour (see data supplement in the online version of this paper).\r\nAll seats in the train carriage were taken by 20 computer-generated characters, known as ‘avatars’ – these were male and female, and several different ethnicities were represented. At the first stop, one avatar disembarked and another boarded. Importantly, the avatars were programmed to exhibit only neutral behaviour; they could glance up and around the carriage and they changed facial ex<x>pressions occasionally (for example, smiling), but  they  did not display any overtly hostile or overly friendly behaviour. The background noises and sounds associated with being in a London Underground train  were  played (e.g. when the carriage doors closed participants would hear ‘Mind the closing doors’, while at other times there was the background rumble of a  moving  train).  The environment was designed so that a majority of the general population would find it a neutral experience.\r\nThe virtual environment was displayed in an immersive projection system commonly referred to as a ‘CAVE’ (Fakespace Systems, Iowa) (Cruz-Neira et al, 1993), with four projection walls  (3  walls and the floor). The specific system was a ReaCTor (Trimension, West Sussex). Participants had their head position and\r\norientation tracked with an inertial/ ultrasonic system (IS900 VET tracking system; Intersense, Massachusetts). They also carried a tracked (Intersense) joystick in their right hand. They wore lightweight CrystalEye LCD shutterglasses (Stereo- Graphics, California), which delivered a stereo view of the virtual world, which  surrounded them on four sides. Participants could move through the virtual environment with a combination of walking and whole  body  turning,  and  also by pressing\r\na   button   on   the  joystick,   which moved them forwards in the virtual space in the direction in which they were pointing.\r\n\r\nAssessment instruments\r\n\r\nPre-virtual reality measures The Green et al Paranoid Thoughts Scales (G–PTS; further details available  from C.G.) is a newly developed instrument to measure current ideas of reference and current ideas of persecution based upon a precise definition of persecutory ideation (Freeman & Garety, 2004). The two sub- scales are both 16-item self-report measures\r\nscored from 1 to 5 (1¼not at all, 5¼totally). The scales have displayed good reliability and validity in a large non-clinical sample and in a clinical sample of 50 individuals with persecutory delusions.\r\nThe Paranoia Scale (PS; Fenigstein & Vanable, 1992) is a 20-item self-report scale to assess paranoia in the general population, and includes items assessing both ideas of persecution and reference. Each item is rated on a five-point scale (1–5). Total scores can range from 20 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater paranoid ideation. The PS has demonstrated good re- liability and validity in a large non-clinical sample. This measure was included as an\r\nadditional reliability check for the newer G–PTS, and to enable comparison of the levels of paranoia in the group with other studies. The Interpersonal Sensitivity Scale (IPSM; Boyce & Parker, 1989) is a 36-item scale designed to assess interpersonal sensitivity. Self-statements are rated on a four- point scale (1¼very unlike self, 4¼very like self). The scale generates a total score ranging from 36 to 144 as well as five sub-scales: ‘interpersonal awareness’ (7 items, range 1–28); ‘need for approval’ (8 items, range 8–32); ‘separation anxiety’ (8 items, range 8–32); ‘timidity’ (8 items, range 8–32) and ‘fragile inner self’ (5 items, range 5–20). Higher scores indicate greater interpersonal sensitivity. The IPSM  has good psychometric properties.\r\nThe Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) is a 42-item instrument with three sub-scales measuring current negative emotional states of stress, anxiety and depression. Each of the sub-scales consists of  14  items  with  a  0–3  scale  (0¼did not apply at all to me, 3¼applied to me very much). Participants are asked to rate the extent to which they have experienced each state over the past week. The psychometric qualities of this scale have recently been\r\nestablished in a large UK non-clinical population (Crawford & Henry, 2003).\r\nThe Launay–Slade Hallucinations Scale  (LSHS;  Launay  &  Slade,   1981)  is a 12-item self-report scale to measure hallucinatory predisposition by assessing clinical and sub-clinical hallucinatory phenomena. Participants answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to each item. Higher scores indicate a  greater  predisposition  to  hallucinatory experiences.\r\nThe ‘Beads Task’ (Garety et al, 1991) assesses data gathering style. Individuals are presented with a pair of containers holding beads of  two  different  colours  in a given ratio (in this study 60:40). The ratio of colours is reversed in each jar. With the containers hidden from view, a bead is drawn from one container, shown to the participant and then replaced. The task  is  to work out which container has been chosen. Individuals with delusions typically require significantly fewer items than con- trols before making a decision, indicating the presence of a data gathering or ‘jumping-to-conclusions’ bias (van Dael  et al, 2006).\r\nThe Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST; Heaton et al, 1993) is the most widely used test for executive functioning in schizophrenia research (van Beilen, 2004). Scores are calculated for the number and percentage of errors, correct responses, perseverative and non-perseverative responses, and perseverative and non- perseverative errors. In the current study perseverative errors (higher scores reflect- ing greater mental inflexibility) was the variable of interest.\r\nThe National Adult Reading Test (NART; Nelson, 1982) aims to give an accurate measure of (pre-morbid) IQ by assessing the ability to read non-phonetic words.\r\n\r\nPost-virtual reality measures\r\n\r\nPre- and Post Virtual Reality Visual Analogue Scales In order to assess whether the procedure caused distress in participants, state anxiety was assessed before and after entering the virtual environment by asking individuals to mark a standard 10 cm visual analogue scale from 0 (not at all anxious) to 10 (extremely anxious). Similarly, participants were asked to rate on a 10 cm visual analogue scale how  unpleasant  (score  0) or pleasant (score 10) their experience  in the tube had been.\r\n\r\nThe Virtual Reality Questionnaire (Freeman et al, 2005)\r\n\r\nThis is a 20-item self-report questionnaire used to assess thoughts about the virtual reality avatars. Each item is scored on a 1–5 scale (1¼do not agree, 5¼totally agree). The scale has 3 sub-scales: virtuality reality–persecution (e.g. ‘Someone had it in for me’, ‘Someone stared at me in order to upset me’, ‘Someone was trying to isolate me’, ‘Someone was trying to make me distressed’); virtual reality–neutral (e.g. ‘No-one had any particular feelings about me’) and virtual reality–positive (e.g. ‘I felt very safe in their company’). The higher the score on a sub-scale the more items were endorsed.\r\n\r\nThe Post Virtual Reality Semi-Structured Interview (Freeman et al, 2003)\r\n\r\nThis is a 10-min semi-structured interview conducted to assess the spontaneous impressions participants made of the environment and the virtual characters. The interviews were tape recorded and then rated (masked to responses on the question- naires) for persecutory content on a 6-point scale (0¼none to 5¼marked). This score from interview was used as a validity check for the self-report virtual reality-persecution scale.\r\nPresence is the extent to which participants in a virtual reality respond to virtual objects and events as if they are real. One of the methods of assessing presence is by the use of a self-rating questionnaire. In this study we used a Presence Questionnaire (Slater et al, 1998) that consists of 6 items, each rated on a scale of 1 to 7 with higher scores indicating greater sense of presence. In the present study, a high sense of presence was defined as a score 6  or  7. No normative reliability or  validity  data  are currently available on this measure, however it has been used in many experimental studies with consistent results (e.g. Slater & Steed, 2000).\r\n\r\nFollow-up assessment\r\n\r\nTo investigate whether the virtual reality experience had triggered any persisting adverse reactions, all participants were contacted by telephone 1 week after the experiment. Participants were asked whether they had thought about the experiment, whether they had had any intrusions regarding the virtual reality environment, and whether their mood and behaviour had been affected in any way by the experiment.\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\n\r\nThe study had received approval from the local NHS research ethics committee. Oral and written information about the study was given to the patients and written in- formed consent obtained. Participants were asked to complete the measures described above before entering the virtual environment. There was then a training task to help  participants  familiarise  themselves with virtual reality. Once a  participant was comfortable with the equipment, the experimental environment was presented. Within the virtual reality training module, a  ‘door’  was  opened  revealing  a  passage to the underground train. Participants were instructed to enter the carriage and to stay on board for two stops. They were asked to form an impression of their environment and the people in the carriage – in particular, what they felt towards  the  people  on the tube and what they thought the people on the tube felt  towards  them.  The ‘journey’  lasted  for  4 min,  and  took  them on  the  London  Underground  Central Line from ‘St Paul’s’, stopping at ‘Chancery Lane’, through to ‘Holborn’ where the participant was to disembark. While on the train, the participant was free to move up and down the carriage. Station stops were announced via a recording played through the audio system. After the virtual tube ride, participants were asked to  complete a post-virtual reality visual analogue anxiety    measure,    the    Virtual    Reality Questionnaire, the Presence Questionnaire, and a brief semi-structured interview with the researcher. Participants received a small payment to reimburse their time.\r\n\r\nStatistical analysis\r\n\r\nAll analyses were conducted using SPSS for Windows (Version 13). All significance test results are quoted as two-tailed probabilities. Associations between the pre-virtual reality measures and persecutory ideation in virtual reality were examined  by Pearson’s correlations. With 21 participants, the study had 80% power to detect a correlation coefficient of 0.54 at a significance level of 0.05 using a two-tailed test (i.e. the study had power only to detect large effect sizes). The study was designed to test the applicability of  the  procedures to a group with at-risk mental state and predict the occurrence of paranoia within this patient group, meaning that a control group was unnecessary.\r\n\r\n RESULTS\r\n\r\nThe demographic and clinical characteristics of the participants are displayed in Tables 1 and 2. Most of the participants were young men in full-time employment or students. A substantial proportion (43%) were from minority ethnic groups.\r\nAll participants were experiencing attenuated positive symptoms, although a quarter of the participants (n¼5) also had a history of a BLIP (a very brief period of frank psychosis) and a minority (n¼2) had a family history of mental health problems. The Global Assessment of Functioning Scale mean score was 56.7 (s.d.¼13.5). The sample had an average IQ, as indexed by the NART. Scores on the G–PTS were highly correlated with scores on the PS (R¼0.91, P50.001).\r\n\r\nExperience of the virtual reality environment\r\nOn average 29% of the participants en- dorsed a score 6 or 7 on the Presence Questionnaire (i.e. had the greatest sense of immersion in the experience). The degree of immersion in the virtual reality environment can be illustrated by considering one of the items of the Presence Questionnaire, ‘the sense of actually being in the tube train versus being in the laboratory’. Participants were asked to rate how much they agreed with this statement on a visual analogue scale ranging from 1 (laboratory) to 7 (tube train); 12 participants (57%) felt they  were in a tube train during the experiment (i.e. scored 5, 6 or 7), two people (10%) scored 4 on this item, while 7 participants (33%) had a sense of being in a laboratory (i.e. scored 3, 2 or 1). The virtual reality experience was rated as pleasant (45%) or neutral (25%) by the majority of participants, while a minority rated it as unpleasant (30%). Anxiety  did not increase from before virtual reality (mean anxiety score¼3.2, s.d.¼2.4) to after it (mean anxiety score¼3.7, s.d.¼3.3), Z¼71.065,   P¼0.287.   At   the   one-week follow-up, 16 participants (76%) reported having thought about the virtual reality experience (e.g. ‘I spoke to my friend about it’ or ‘I thought about it a couple of times, be- cause it was real and unreal at the same time. I quite liked it’), but none of the participants reported having had unsolicited or intrusive thoughts or images. No participant reported negative emotions associated with the experience at follow-up and no one had modified their behaviour or avoided going anywhere because of the experiment.\r\n\r\nPersecutory ideation in the virtual reality environment\r\nThe majority of participants (57%) en- dorsed at least one paranoid item in relation to the avatars on the virtual reality– persecution sub-scale. The most endorsed item was ‘Someone was trying to make  me distressed’; 10% ‘agreed a little’ with this statement, 10% ‘agreed moderately’ and 24% ‘agreed very much’ with it. The least endorsed item was ‘Someone  had  it in for me’; 15% of the participants ‘agreed a little’ and 5% ‘agreed moderately’ with this statement. Almost all participants (95%) endorsed at least one neutral item about the virtual reality environment, and 86% agreed with at least one positive statement. Overall, although most of the participants	reported	some paranoid experiences, the environment was mainly experienced as neutral or positive. The masked ratings of persecutory ideation from the recorded post-virtual reality semi-structured interview significantly correlated   with   virtual   reality–persecution scores (R¼0.60, P¼0.005). The interview of one participant could not be  recorded and scored due to a technical problem with the tape recorder. When interviewed, 13 participants (65%) reported neutral or positive impressions about the virtual reality experience (e.g. ‘They did not have any ex<x>pression, I did not think anything about them’, ‘One girl kept smiling at me, she may have fancied me’). The remaining\r\n7  participants  (35%)  reported  slight  to moderate  paranoid  interpretations  (e.g. ‘I\r\nthought one girl was staring at me. She made me angry. I wanted to hit her, so I moved away’, ‘I felt that some people were against me because of their body-language and the whispering and the laughing. I thought that some of them wanted to harm me and that they had an attitude. I felt very angry  towards   them,   and   if somebody would have said anything to me I would\r\nhave wanted to harm them.’).\r\nCorrelations of the measures with the sub-scales of the Virtual Reality Questionnaire are shown in Table 3. The key sub-scale for this study is virtual reality– persecution. It had 10 significant correlations and 8 non-significant  correlations with the other measures. Persecutory ideation in virtual reality was predicted by higher levels of  trait  paranoia,  anxiety, stress, ideas of a fragile inner self, immersion in virtual reality, and perseveration. On the beads task four participants (19%) ‘jumped to conclusions’ (i.e. decided after three beads or fewer) and all but one produced the correct  answer.  However,  the number of draws needed to come to a decision on the beads task was not associated with the occurrence of paranoid thinking    in    virtual    reality    (R¼70.02, P¼0.950).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nOur first concern when using this novel experimental technology with a clinical group at high risk of psychosis was to ensure its safety. The study has demonstrated the safety of the procedures: there were no ad- verse reactions, levels of anxiety were not raised, and the experiment did not create intrusive thoughts. Indicating the clinical and research promise of this approach, many of the individuals with at-risk mental state   did   experience unfounded  paranoid\r\nthoughts  about the virtual reality  characters. These individuals were more likely to experience paranoid thoughts in day-to- day life, validating the methodology. A method of capturing paranoid thoughts in the laboratory for this clinical group has therefore been shown. There is also there- fore the longer-term potential for the procedures to be adapted for aiding psycho- logical interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the causes of paranoid thoughts\r\n\r\nOur second hypothesis was that persecutory ideas induced by the virtual reality procedure would be associated with a number of baseline factors thought to play a key role in the development of psychosis. Cognitive  models  of  delusions postulate that paranoid thoughts are appraisals of experiences (e.g. Bentall et al, 1994; Garety et al, 2001; Freeman et al, 2002, 2006; Broome et al, 2005a). The appraisals are hypothesised to be influenced by emotional processes and reasoning biases. Uniquely, virtual reality enables researchers to investigate the determinants of such appraisals (such as emotion or reasoning) by control- ling the event, so that everyone is exposed to a similar experience. As predicted  by  the cognitive model of persecutory delusions, anxiety, stress and interpersonal sensitivities were associated with higher levels of paranoid ideation in the virtual reality tube environment. There were also trends for depression to be associated with the presence of paranoid thoughts in virtual reality. Intriguingly, the results exactly match those of the previous virtual reality studies with non-clinical populations (Freeman et al, 2003, 2005), which found the same as- sociations between paranoid ideations and other variables. This is supportive of a continuum view of psychotic experiences. The current study also examined executive functioning in relation to paranoid thinking. A perseverative thinking style was positively correlated with persecutory ideation. This suggests that a rigid thinking style might be associated with persecutory appraisals. Perseverative errors on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test are often interpreted as reflecting cognitive  inflexibility,  and  they  are  a    consistent    finding    in    patients  with schizophrenia compared with non-clinical controls (van Beilen, 2004). Intriguingly, our results in participants with an at-risk mental state exactly match those of the previous virtual reality studies in non- clinical populations (Freeman et al, 2003, 2005), which found the same associations between paranoid ideations and these variables. This suggests that similar mechanisms may underlie anomalous experiences in clinical and non-clinical samples and is supportive of a continuum view of psychotic experiences.\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nA key limitation of the current work is the small sample size. This means that the generalisability of the results to other at-risk mental state groups may  be  limited. Further, there was limited ability to detect associations with the pre-virtual reality assessments. Examining interactions be- tween  predictors  was  also  precluded  by the sample size. The scope of the study would have been widened  by  the  inclusion of a matched non-clinical group. The question could then have been addressed of whether individuals at risk of psychosis have greater levels of paranoia in virtual reality compared with non-clinical individuals. It could also be argued that the use of virtual reality technology might be off- putting for potential participants in re- search, and that only a highly selected group take part. Our anecdotal evidence from this study is that at-risk mental state individuals who did not wish to take part did so for reasons unrelated to the technology (e.g. being in full-time employment, not being interested in any kind of research, being away on holiday).\r\n\r\nClinical implications\r\n\r\nVirtual reality is a safe and feasible technique that can be used to investigate the factors associated with paranoid ideations not only in the general population but also in a clinical sample. By creating a con- trolled situation, environmental factors associated with paranoia could be investigated. Furthermore,  virtual  reality  could  be integrated into cognitive–behavioural interventions for psychosis (e.g. Valmaggia et al, 2005). Integrated into cognitive– behavioural therapy, virtual reality could help patients with delusions test out their beliefs and try alternative coping strategies (Greenwood et al, 2006).\r\n\r\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by a programme grant from the Wellcome Trust (No. 062452).

Dental practitioners have numerous methods to control anxiety and pain in children, and distracting the child appears to be the most common technique used for behavior management during dental procedures. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of using virtual reality eyeglasses on severity of pain and anxiety during dental procedures in pediatric patients.\r\n\r\nMaterials and methods. This study included 120 healthy children aged 4-6 years. Children with no previous anxiety disorder were randomly divided into two groups, each consisting of 60 children. The study consisted of 3 consecutive treatment sessions. During the first visit fluoride therapy was carried out in both groups. In the next sessions, the groups received restorative treatment with and without virtual reality eyeglasses in a randomized single-blind-controlled crossover fashion. Then at the end of each session the subjects’ pain severity was assessed using Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating\r\nScale and state anxiety was measured by Faces version of the Modified Child Dental Anxiety Scale [MCDAS (f)].\r\n\r\nResults. There was a significant decrease in pain perception (P < 0.001) and state anxiety scores (P < 0.001) with the use of virtual reality eyeglasses during dental treatment.\r\n\r\nConclusion. Results of this study showed that virtual reality eyeglasses can successfully decrease pain perception and state anxiety during dental treatment. Trial registration number: 201103126036N1.\r\n\r\nKey words: Anxiety, dental treatment, distraction, pain, virtual reality.\r\n\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nPain and anxiety are unpleasant feelings and emotional experiences, which are associated with real or possible traumas to tissues. Management strategies have been proposed to reduce distress during dental treatment in children and are mainly divided into two broad categories. The first module\r\nconsists of behavioral techniques including the tell- show-do technique, distraction, inspiration, modeling and hypnotism. The second category consists of pharmacologic techniques.2,3\r\nDistraction appears to be safe and inexpensive and gives rise to an effective relaxed experience in short\r\npainful dental procedure. Previous studies have shown that distraction is the most common technique\r\nused to reduce pain in short invasive medical procedures. The application of distraction is based on the assumption that pain perception has a large psychological component in that the amount of attention directed to the noxious stimuli modulates the perceived pain. Although the precise mechanism of distraction is not yet well understood, cognitive-affective attention models may explain this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nMcCaul and Mallet developed the existing theory by placing emphasis on the fact that the capacity of humans to pay attention is limited. They point out that an individual should concentrate on the painful stimuli in order to perceive pain; therefore, perception of pain decreases when a person’s attention is distracted away from the stimulus. Based on the results of a number of studies the ideal process of distraction requires the capture of the child’s various senses such as vision, hearing and touch and actively engaging the child’s emotions. Therefore the ideal distracter would require an optimal amount of attention involving multiple sensory modalities (visual, auditory, and kinesthetic), active emotional involvement and participation of the patient to compete with the signals from the noxious stimuli.\r\n\r\nPrevious techniques to distract a child include watching television, listening to music, counting the furniture in the room and non-medical dialogs, which serve to distract the child’s attention from\r\nanxiety-provoking stimuli. Comparing three distraction techniques for reducing stress in patients, Seyrek et al.10 found that video techniques were more effective than an audio program. Results further suggested that successful distraction was accompanied by an increase in physiological arousal, possibly indicating the degree of psychological absorption or engagement in the video.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in behavioral research in virtual reality (VR) and virtual world. VR refers to a human–computer interface that enables the user to interact dynamically with the computer-generated environment. In contrast to the less complex audiovisual (A/V) distraction, VR uses sophisticated systems such as head-mounted, wide field-of-view; three-dimensional displays (HMDs) and motion sensing systems that measure the user’s head and hand positions. This application may be superior to traditional distraction because it offers more immersive images due to the occlusive head sets that project the images right in front of the eyes of the user and, depending on the model used, block out real-world (visual, auditory, or both) stimuli. VR even combines the audio, visual, and kinesthetic sensory modalities. Depending on how immersive the presented stimuli are, the person’s attention will be more or less “drained” from the real world, leaving less attention available to real-world processes, including painful stimuli. Immersion is particularly increased during VR because the use of HMDs prevents patients from seeing what is happening in the real world and directs the focus on what is going on in the virtual world. Therefore, the child’s attention is focused on what happen in the virtual world rather than on the surrounding environment.8 Sullivan et al.11 demonstrated that using virtual reality during dental treatment had no significant effect on the behavior or anxiety but significantly reduced the pulse. Literature review reveals sparse investigations regarding the use of VR technique in children. To date, there have been no studies evaluating the effect of\r\n\r\nVR distraction on the pain perception and state anxiety in children considering primary childhood anxiety disorders as an important confounding variable. In the present study, an attempt was made to eliminate the effects of childhood anxiety disorders during the use of VR distraction during routine dental treatment. The objective of this study was to answer the question, as to whether VR distraction is effective in reducing pain and anxiety as adjunct to traditional behavior management strategies in the dental setting and procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMaterials and Methods\r\n\r\nThis single-blind crossover clinical trial study was carried out in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry\r\nat Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the Re- search Ethics Committee of Tabriz University of medical Sciences (Ref: 89.50). The participants consisted of 120 children between 4-6 years of age who attended Department of Pediatric Dentistry of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences for routine dental care from November 2011 until March 2012. Children who did not have anxiety disorders at the first attendance according toSCARED questionnaire were included in the study.\r\n\r\nOther inclusion criteria were the first attendance and presence of at least two carious mandibular primary molars requiring restorative treatment. From the 250 children matching the inclusion criteria, 120 subjects were randomized into two groups. A random allocation list was generated using a randomization software (RandList version 1.2; DatIng GmbH, Tübingen, Deutschland; seed number: 1,901,365,632) to allocate subjects to any of the groups, one by one according to their order of ad- mission.\r\n\r\nThe treatment consisted of three consecutive sessions. All dental procedures were carried out by one pediatric dentist. The VR device (i-glasses 920HR Ilixco, Inc. Menlo Park, CA, USA) used during the dental procedures blocked the visual field of the child completely and had headphones to deliver the sound. The device was connected to a player capable of playing MP4 audio-visual files. A single episode of the cartoon series “Tom and Jerry” was played for all subjects throughout the study.\r\nIn the first session, all the children in both groups received fluoride therapy without any intervention.\r\nIn the second session VR device was introduced to the subjects in group 1 using tell-show-do technique before treatment. Once VR device was adopted on the child’s eyes, playing the cartoon was started. Then, topical anesthetic agent was placed by a piece of cotton roll on the injection site,12 and inferior alveolar block injection was administered, followed by a primary mandibular molar restoration. Subjects in group 2 received similar procedures without the use of VR distraction. In the third appointment which\r\ntook place 1 to 2 weeks after the second session,primary mandibular molar restoration with inferior alveolar nerve block injection was performed with and without VR distraction in groups 2 and 1, respectively. Each therapeutic session lasted about half an hour.\r\n\r\nThe Instruments\r\nScreen for Child Anxiety Related Disorder (SCARED) Questionnaire: The parent version of this questionnaire has been designed to evaluate symptoms as a result of separation anxiety, overall anxiety, phobic disorders, compulsive disorders, fear of trauma, social phobia, specific phobia and fear of school in children under 8 years of age. The questionnaire was used to evaluate the presence of childhood background anxiety disorders in the subjects. In this questionnaire, scores above 25 indicate the\r\npresence of childhood anxiety disorders and were excluded from the study.13 The Persian format of the\r\nquestionnaire had been used in previous studies. Faces version of the Modified Child Dental\r\nAnxiety Scale [MCDAS(f)] Questionnaire: This questionnaire is used for evaluating state anxiety in\r\nwide age range in children during dental procedures. This index is self-reported and consists of 8 questions with 5 pictorial answers for each question. Scores on the MCDAS(f) scale may range from 8 to\r\n40, with scores below 19 indicating absence of state anxiety, scores higher than 19 indicating the presence of state anxiety and scores higher than 31, indicating severe phobic disorder (Figure 1).16 The\r\n\r\nPersian format of this questionnaire had also been used in previous studies.Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale: This technique was used to assess pain perceived during dental procedures. It consists of a number of faces ranging from happy to crying. The children were asked to indicate the level of pain they perceived on this pictorial index (Figure 2).17 Once the treatment is completed, the eyeglasses were removed.11 Wong Baker FACES Pain Rating Scale, which is a self-reported scale was explained and shown to the subjects immediately after treatment and they were asked to show the face which\r\nbest depicted the pain level they experienced during treatment. Faces version of the Modified Children\r\nDental Anxiety Scale [MCDAS (f)] was used to Figure 1. Faces version of the Modified Child Dental\r\nAnxiety Scale [MCDAS(f)] Questionnaire evaluate state anxiety of the subjects in a manner similar to the evaluation of pain.\r\n\r\nData Analysis\r\n\r\nData were analyzed using SPSS version 15.0 software (SPSS Inc.). Chi-square or Fisher’s Exact Test was used to assess gender difference between the two groups. Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare age and anxiety disorders (SCARED) scores differences between the two groups. Paired samples and independent sample t-tests were used to compare the level of pain and state anxiety. The Kappa statistic was calculated for inter- and intra-rater reliability assessments. The statistical significance was set to 0.05.\r\n\r\nResults\r\nThree of the 120 subjects failed to attend the second and third treatment sessions, leaving a total of 117 subjects in the present study. The overall mean age of patients was 5.4 years (range, 4-6). The mean ages of the subjects in groups 1 and 2 were 5.18 ± 0.67 and 5.65 ± 0.71 years, respectively. No significant difference was seen in the means of ages between the two groups (P = 0.81). The subjects comprised 33 boys and 25 girls in group 1 and 30 boys and 29 girls in group 2, with no statistically significant differences between the two groups regarding gender (Fisher’s Exact test, P =0.75). The mean SCARED score was 16.74 ± 1.52 in groups 1 and 16.65 ± 2.03 in group 2 Childhood Anxiety-Related Disorders scores did not differ significantly between the two groups (Mann-Whitney U test, P = 0.81).\r\nIn group 1, the mean faces scale pain scores in the first (with VR distraction) and second (without VR distraction) treatment sessions were 1.89 ± 0.65 and 3.00 ± 0.81, respectively. These values represent a statistically significant increase in pain score. In group 2, the mean of faces scale pain score was 3.05\r\n± 0.60 in the first treatment session (without VR distraction), which decreased to 2.05 ± 0.60 in the second session (with VR distraction). In both groups, a statistically significant difference was detected between the two treatment sessions (P < 0.001; Figure 3).\r\nSimilarly, in group 1 the Mean MCDAS (f) anxiety scores in the first (with VR distraction) and second\r\n(without VR distraction) treatment sessions were 12.58 ± 1.01 and 17.68 ± 1.25, respectively. These values represent a statistically significant increase in anxiety score. In group 2, the Mean MCDAS (f) anxiety scores was 18.25 ± 1.02 in the first treatment session (without VR distraction), which decreased to 13.20 ± 1.00 in the second treatment session (with VR distraction). In both groups, a statistically significant difference was detected between the two treatment sessions (P < 0.001; Figure 4).\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\nThis study tested the effects of distraction using virtual-reality technology on pain perception and anxiety level in children who were primarily screened in order to childhood anxiety related disorders as an important confounding factor in the dental setting.\r\n\r\nFigure 2.

Trait anxiety\r\nrefers to a general level of stress that is characteristic of an individual, that is, a trait related to personality; and has a constant level during the life span.18 It has been shown that patients who have a high level of trait anxiety usually report higher levels of anxiety and pain during dental procedures,19,20 and do not respond well to distraction techniques.21 To the best of our knowledge previous studies have not taken into account the influence of the issue and therefore, in our study, SCARED questionnaire was used to exclude the children who had anxiety disorders as a confounding affects of anxious personality on dental anxiety.18 Since individuals have different pain thresholds, the present study was designed as a crossover study so that each individual would be compared with themselves in two different situations and, therefore the differences in pain threshold would not result in bias in reporting the results. Moreover, unpleasant pain experience can increase pain perception and anxiety during the next sessions, resulting, in turn, to perceive more pain.20 It has also been demonstrated\r\n that distraction techniques are less effective in individuals who have a previous bitter pain experience.9\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the present study subjects were excluded if they had previous invasive painful medical or dental history. The results of the present study showed that use of VR distraction was effective in decreasing pain perception and state anxiety level in children without anxiety disorders during routine dental treatment. In same line, review of the literature revealed a decrease in the stress levels in the majority of studies using VR distraction.2,22,23 Several studies have shown that VR distraction has positive effect on pain, anxiety and behavior during medical procedures such as treatment of traumatic injuries, burn care, dental procedures, chemotherapy, injection or blood sampling, and physiotherapy.2,22-29 These benefits may be related to more immersive images due to the occlusive headsets that project the images right in front of the eyes of the user and block out real- world (visual, auditory, or both) stimuli. The child’s attention is focused on what happen in the virtual world rather than on the surrounding environment.VR even combines the audio, visual, and kinesthetic sensory modalities. Therefore VR, being the most immersive of all and depending on how immersive the presented stimuli are, the person’s attention will be more or less “drained” from the real world, leaving less attention available to process other real-world, including painful stimuli.11,24 The application of VR distraction is based on the assumption that pain perception has a large psychological component and that pain attracts a strong attentive response because of the potential threat of damaged tissue associated with the sensation. The redirection (distraction) of this attention manipulates the pain perception, thereby reducing the intensity of pain. Recently it has also been found that VR changes the way people interpret incoming pain signals and actually reduces the amount of pain-related brain activity. Moreover it can be concluded that VR engages the conscious attention of the patient, resulting in less pain perception by the patients.24 By diverting attention from an unpleasant medical setting to a pleasant and absorbing virtual world, while also engaging higher cognitive and emotional centers of the nervous system, VR can markedly diminish a patient’s subjective pain experience. In addition, researchers have evaluated the neurobiological mechanism of VR technique in the brain by fMRI and have concluded that the effect of VR technique on pain perception is beyond simple distraction. 31 VR technique produces a deep illusion of entering a virtual world produced by a computer through coordination of sensory perceptions (vision, hearing and sometimes touch), which is referred to as “presence”. Presence forms a basis for VR technique. In fact, the level of presence in the virtual world reflects the amount of attention that individual directs towards the virtual atmosphere; the more an\r\n\r\nFigure 4. The error bars of state anxiety severity as determined by MCDAS(f) in the two groups under\r\n\r\nstudy. Group 1: VR device used in the second appointment; Group 2: VR device used in the third appointment.\r\n\r\nIndividual is absorbed in the virtual world, the less he/she is expected to perceive pain.32 Moreover using fMRI to monitor brain activity during pain distraction, studies have demonstrated that cortical areas associated with attentional processes and pain modulation are more active during distraction, whereas areas associated with pain perception are less ac-\r\ntive. Additional advantages for the use of virtual reality include ease of use, greater control of the therapy, safe in the majority of patients, no need for instructing the patients and the therapeutic personnel. In addition, frequent application of the technique does not decrease its positive effects.25 Therefore, it can easily be used in children and with some size modifications in adults.19\r\nIn accordance with our result, previous studies have shown the efficacy of VR distraction in children. It has shown that VR technique induced a higher level of presence in children compared to adults.26 Das et al.34 reported that older children considered VR technique as a very simple game and therefore younger children are absorbing too much than older children, and therefore have lower level of distraction. These results place great emphasis on the suitability of the selected VR program for the age and personality traits of the subjects, which allows a child to exercise a higher degree of control over the unpleasant stimulus and to imagine himself or herself in a familiar environment.2\r\n\r\nHowever, some contradictory results have also emerged as a result of methodological shortcomings and the use of inappropriate devices. Dahlquist et al21 showed that use of VR technique is more effective in older children than in younger children compared to simple distraction techniques. Since the device used had been designed for adults, the head-phones did not fit very well on young children and therefore did not block the sound and visual field of the surrounding environment in young children. In the present study, smaller size of the VR device was used to accommodate in children. In addition, these devices frequently have been designed for standing or sitting positions, while the device used in the present study is applicable in supine position for dental procedures.\r\nThere are considerations that should be taken into account in virtual reality applications. Hoffman et\r\nal35 reported that a number of patients undergo emotional and nervous states during the first minutes of VR device use and need more time to adapt themselves to the device. In addition, more attention should be paid to differences of personality traits which lead to emotional states in the individual.\r\nFanurik et al8 divided their child subjects into attender and distractor groups. The attender group consisted of children who focused all their attention on the therapeutic process; therefore, lack of the visual field during VR device use meant lack of control for them, which increased their anxiety level. In contrast, distracters were children who focused their attention on processes of the therapeutic procedure; therefore, they experienced less anxiety.24\r\n\r\nIn summary, the findings of the present study confirm the efficacy of VR distraction in the dental setting. The anxiety-inducing appearance of dental equipment and the child’s focusing on all the details of the procedure is one of the most important reasons for stress associated with dental procedures in children. Therefore, the positive effects of VR distraction on the pain and anxiety in children in the present study are attributed to the complete blockage of children’s visual fields, and as a result to a successful distraction technique. Moreover, these benefits may be related to more immersive images due to combination of the audio, visual, and kinesthetic sensory modalities in VR. A limitation of the present study was the fact that the therapeutic procedures were carried out in two separate sessions. It is important to note that the baseline anxiety level of children might be different in each session due to factors such as lack of sleep.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the use of a questionnaire before the procedure in each session to determine the baseline anxiety level in children might assist in eliminating a confounding factor. In addition, since the success of VR technique in distracting the child depends on the appeal of the program played, it is suggested that the patients themselves assist in choosing their favorite programs in order to achieve better results. Another limitation of the present study was the limited age range of the subjects. Children aged 4-6 years of age were included because it has been reported that children at this age range exhibit the most negative and aberrant behaviors during dental procedures and are the most difficult to control.2\r\n\r\nHowever, since different age groups exhibit different cognitive characteristics and behavioral patterns toward VR technique, it is recommended that different age groups be evaluated in future studies. However, considering the fact that children’s anxiety and pain can have different faces with various levels of alarm such as evolving temperament may conspire to affect, positively or negatively, the extrapolation of the results of the present study to a broader sense and\r\n\r\n\r\nVirtual Reality Distraction in Pediatric Dentistry 123 generalization of the findings necessitates further investigation. It is also suggested that the efficacy of VR technique be evaluated in other dental procedures such as extraction and pulp therapy.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nThis study was supported and funded by Tabriz University of Medical sciences.

Cybersickness (CS) is a negative side effect of VR exposure and is associated with treatment dropout. This study aimed to investigate the following: (a) if gender differences in CS can be replicated, (b) if differences in anxiety and CS symptoms between patients and controls can be replicated, and (c) whether the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms is mediated by anxiety. A sample (<italic>N</italic> = 170) of participants with different levels of psychosis liability was exposed to VR environments. CS and anxiety were assessed with self-report measures before and after the VR experiment. This study replicated gender differences in CS symptoms, most of which were present before exposure to VR. It also replicated findings that a significant correlation between anxiety and CS can be found in healthy individuals, but not in patients. In a VR environment, anxiety partially mediated CS symptoms, specifically nausea and disorientation. A partial explanation for the differences found between patients and controls may lie in a ceiling effect for the symptoms of CS. A second explanation may be the partial overlap between CS symptoms and physiological anxiety responses. CS symptoms reported at baseline cannot be explained by exposure to VR, but are related to anxiety. Caution is required when interpreting studies on both CS and anxiety, until the specificity in measurements has been improved. Since anxiety mediated the CS symptoms, CS is expected to decline during treatment together with the reduction of anxiety.\r\n\r\nauthor virtual reality; cybersickness; anxiety; psychosis\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nThe use of virtual reality (VR) in psychological treatment is expected to increase now that affordable technologies are available for clinical implementation.[ 1] VR can be more effective and less burdensome for patients[ 2] and more practical for therapists[ 3] than in vivo (real-life) exposure therapies. The use of VR in treating psychological disorders was introduced about 20 years ago.[ 4] This led to studies on VR treatment for various anxiety disorders,[ 5] eating and weight disorders,[ 6] depression,[ 7] autism spectrum disorders,[ 8] and substance-related disorders,[ 9] as well as paranoid ideation[ 10] and hearing voices[ 11] in psychotic disorders.\r\n\r\nAn important factor contributing to the effect of VR treatment is immersion, that is, the sense of being present in the virtual environment.[ 12] However, a common drawback of using head-mounted displays as a medium for immersive VR environments is the experience of cybersickness (CS),[ 13] also known as simulator sickness. CS is the occurrence of motion sickness-like symptoms when using VR and is related to increased treatment dropout.[ 1] As CS symptoms occur in 60 to 70 percent of participants,[ 14] this has a negative impact on treatment effects. CS is an unintended negative side effect and efforts should be made to limit negative effects while preserving the therapeutic effect of VR.[ 15]\r\n\r\nFour factors are reported to influence the occurrence of CS: ( 1) hardware and software choices for the VR system, ( 2) design of the virtual environment, ( 3) task characteristics, and ( 4) user characteristics.[ 15] ,[ 16] Examples of hardware and software characteristics influencing CS are visual surround of the display[ 17] and navigation (e.g., a mouse, joystick or treadmill).[ 18] The design of the virtual environment can influence CS by using dynamic auditory stimulation[ 19] and allowed movement (active vs. passive).[ 15] Task characteristics known to influence CS are duration of exposure to the virtual environment[ 20] and training.[ 21]\r\n\r\nUser characteristics that can influence CS include gender, affective symptoms, and mental health. Susceptibility to CS is increased for women and varies over the menstrual cycle due to hormonal variation; however, explanations for this gender difference are incomplete.[ 22] Affective symptoms (e.g., feeling stressed or anxious) may increase the experience of CS[ 23] ,[ 24] but the nature of this relationship remains unclear.\r\n\r\nVR treatment is used to expose patients to a virtual representation of their feared stimuli. During VR treatment patients will therefore experience high levels of anxiety. Physiological symptoms of anxiety and CS overlap and may confound both scientific research[ 24] and clinical practice. Anxiety disorders are much more prevalent in women,[ 25] making gender-specific relationships between CS, anxiety, and VR used in psychological treatment, an area of interest. It is also unclear why different findings emerge in healthy individuals and patients. For example, significant correlations between levels of experienced anxiety and CS were found in healthy controls,[ 26] but not in patients diagnosed with persecutory delusions exposed to a neutral VR environment.[ 27]\r\n\r\nHigh levels of CS symptoms were found in patients with an anxiety disorder even before immersion in VR.[ 28] Correlations were found between some CS symptoms and reported anxiety in a sample with both healthy controls and patients with an anxiety disorder.[ 29] Some CS symptoms may reflect anxiety more than side effects.[ 30] Thus, more clarity is required as to which user characteristics influence CS.\r\n\r\nThe present study aimed to investigate the following: (a) if gender differences in CS can be replicated, (b) if differences in anxiety and CS symptoms between patients and controls can be replicated, and (c) whether the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms is mediated by anxiety (Fig. 1).\r\nMaterials and Methods\r\n\r\nParticipants\r\n\r\nA total of 170 participants aged 18–35 years were earlier recruited for a large VR study.[ 31]\r\n\r\nFrom these, we defined a high liability patient group based on phenotype, that is, the experience of (subclinical) psychotic symptoms. This group consisted of two categories:\r\n\r\n- Fifty-five patients with a psychotic disorder according to the DSM-IV, with the exception of substance-induced psychotic disorder, and psychotic disorder due to a medical condition. These patients were recruited at five outpatient departments.\r\n\r\n- Twenty patients with an at-risk mental state (ARMS), recruited among patients seeking help for nonpsychotic psychiatric problems at two outpatient departments.\r\n\r\nThe low psychosis liability control group consisted of:\r\n\r\n- Forty-two siblings of people diagnosed with a psychotic disorder who had no personal history of a psychotic disorder themselves.\r\n\r\n- Fifty-three control persons recruited from the general population; they had no history of psychotic disorder nor a first-degree relative with a psychotic disorder.\r\n\r\nOur previous study in this cohort found no difference in reported symptoms between the siblings and healthy controls,[ 31] allowing to combine both groups for the analysis.\r\n\r\nThe exclusion criteria were poor command of the Dutch language, epilepsy, and intelligence quotient (IQ) ≤75.\r\n\r\nEthical approval\r\n\r\nThis study was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Leiden University Medical Center (NL37356.058.12/P12.182). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.\r\n\r\nVR setting\r\n\r\nThe virtual environment used in this experiment was a café. Participants could navigate the virtual environment using a Logitech F310 Gamepad. The Sony HMZ-T1 head-mounted display used for VR display of the café had a high-density resolution of 1280 × 720 (per eye), with 51.6 diagonal field of view, and built-in headphones. A 3DOF tracker (UM7 Orientation Sensor; CH-Robotics) was added to the Sony HMZ-T1 for head rotation. The researcher controlled the VR system and actions in the virtual environment using a graphical user interface.\r\n\r\nDetailed information on the conditions is already published.[ 31] The social stressors used in this virtual social environment (population density, ethnic density, and hostility) were found to elicit feelings of anxiety.[ 31] All participants participated in five conditions, each with different levels of social stress. Exposure to each condition lasted 4 min. The order of the five conditions was randomized to prevent a sequence effect.\r\n\r\nMeasurement instruments\r\n\r\nDiagnostic instruments\r\n\r\nThe Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States[ 32] was used to assess ARMS before participation. Psychotic disorder was diagnosed with either the Comprehensive Assessment of Symptoms and History[ 33] or the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry.[ 34]\r\n\r\nAnxiety was assessed by self-rated momentary subjective fear in units on an analog scale (subjective unit of distress [SUD]), ranging from 0 (no distress at all) to 100 (worst possible distress). Anxiety was first assessed before the experiments. Participants also rated their maximum anxiety during VR immediately after each of the five experiments. The mean of these five maximum anxiety scores was calculated and used for the analyses.\r\n\r\nThe self-report Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ)[ 35] was administered before and after the VR experiments. The SSQ measure\'s three distinct symptom clusters were labeled as Oculomotor (eyestrain, difficulty focusing, blurred vision, headache), Disorientation (dizziness, vertigo), and Nausea (nausea, stomach awareness, increased salivation, burping). The SSQ was scored according to the procedures by Kennedy et al.[ 35]\r\n\r\nAnalyses\r\n\r\nAnalyses were conducted with IBM SPSS version 23. For sociodemographic characteristics, differences in continuous variables between the groups were analyzed using t tests. If the distribution of a continuous variable was skewed a Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used. Group differences in categorical variables were tested using χ2 analysis. Pearson\'s correlation coefficient (two-tailed) was used for correlations.\r\n\r\nWe used the MEMORE method[ 36] for two-condition within-participant statistical mediation analysis. The single test path-analytic approach by MEMORE eliminates the need for multiple discrete hypothesis tests about components of the mediation model, as the previous dominant approach[ 37] requires. A single test decreases the probability of an error occurring. The conditions were no exposure (baseline) and exposure to VR. MEMORE can be used to estimate the total (c), direct (c\'), and indirect (ab) effects of exposure to VR on CS and its subscales through anxiety in a two-condition repeated measures design. Bootstrapping ( 5,000 samples) was used. Fixed covariates such as gender (or other stable individual differences) are accounted for in the MEMORE model.\r\nResults\r\n\r\nDemographics\r\n\r\nA total of 170 participants were included: 95 controls in the low-liability group and 75 patients in the high-liability group. Sociodemographic characteristics of the participants as well as anxiety and CS scores are presented in Table 1. Controls had a higher level of education and a lower use of psychiatric medication. There was a trend of more female participants in the control group.\r\n\r\nTable 1.

In contrast, after exposure to VR, patients no longer showed a significant correlation between anxiety and CS (r = 0.19, p = 0.11), whereas the controls did (r = 0.53, p < 0.01).\r\n\r\nAnxiety as mediator variable\r\n\r\nFor all 170 participants, a significant correlation was found between anxiety and CS at baseline (r = 0.33, p < 0.01) and after exposure to VR (r = 0.34, p < 0.01).\r\n\r\nMediation results are presented in Table 2.\r\n\r\nTable 2.

CS was measured by the self-report SSQ. Anxiety was assessed by self-rated momentary subjective fear (SUD). MEMORE was used for two-condition within-participant statistical mediation analysis. The conditions were no exposure (baseline) and exposure to virtual reality. Fixed covariates, such as gender, are accounted for in the MEMORE model.\r\n    5 <0.05; ** <0.01.\r\n    6 SD, standard deviation.\r\n\r\nAnxiety mediated the relationship between exposure to a VR environment and the experience of CS. The direct effect (c\') remained significant, implying that the mediation effect of anxiety on CS was partial. Examination of the CS subscales revealed that the relationship between exposure to VR and nausea was partially mediated by anxiety. The relationship between exposure to VR and disorientation was also partially mediated by anxiety. Oculomotor symptoms had no direct relationship (c) with exposure to VR.\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nIn this VR study, the large majority of patients and controls reported at least one symptom of CS. We replicated both gender differences in CS and differences in CS between patients and controls. The relationship between exposure to VR and CS was partially mediated by anxiety. This implies that part of the relationship between exposure to VR and CS symptoms, more specifically nausea and disorientation, was explained by anxiety as an intermediary variable.\r\n\r\nWomen reported more CS symptoms than men, but most of these differences were already present at baseline. When exposed to VR, women had a steeper increase in nausea symptoms. The gender difference in severity of CS symptoms is in accordance with others.[ 22] However, gender differences in oculomotor and disorientation symptoms existed before VR exposure and cannot be explained by either exposure to VR or anxiety levels.\r\n\r\nOur results replicate both findings about CS symptoms being present before exposure to VR in patients with an anxiety disorder,[ 28] and associations found between anxiety and CS symptoms.[ 29] ,[ 30] Our results replicate findings that significant correlations between anxiety and CS were found in controls[ 26] but not in patients.[ 27] ,[ 28] Our study indicates that a partial explanation may lie in a ceiling effect for CS symptoms, that is, CS symptoms were already high in patients before VR and remained high, whereas they were low in healthy controls before VR and increased during VR. A second explanation may be the partial overlap between CS symptoms and physiological anxiety responses.\r\n\r\nCS symptoms reported at baseline cannot be explained by exposure to VR, but are related to anxiety. The present study found that anxiety was a mediating factor for nausea and disorientation symptoms of CS, but not oculomotor symptoms. This suggests that anxiety may impact some, but not all symptoms of CS. This is in line with studies showing five individual symptoms of CS (general discomfort, fatigue, headache, difficulty concentrating, and fullness of head) to correlate with reported anxiety.[ 29] ,[ 30] Especially two CS symptoms, general discomfort and difficulty concentrating, may reflect anxiety symptoms as they significantly load on the anxiety factor.[ 30] This is also in line with a study demonstrating that nausea symptoms are affected by reported anxiety.[ 24]\r\n\r\nWe found no increase in oculomotor symptoms after exposure to VR; previous research on the profile of CS found that oculomotor symptoms are the least likely to occur,[ 38] which may have influenced the statistical power. It is also possible that oculomotor symptoms (e.g., eyestrain and blurred vision) are physiologically less related to anxiety symptoms. The fact that mediation by anxiety is partial and is consistent with the finding that multiple factors influence CS.[ 18]\r\n\r\nStrengths and limitations\r\n\r\nThe primary strength of the study is that the CS symptoms were measured before and after exposure to VR. Also, three different CS subscales were measured instead of only nausea, or using a single-sickness scale. Second strength is that the inclusion of both patients and controls allowed examining group differences. Thirdly, the MEMORE method simultaneously used the CS and anxiety scores before exposure to VR, as well as scores after exposure, to estimate mediation effects.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the statistical power of this study was limited, as many participants reported little CS and little or no anxiety symptoms; this impeded more detailed analysis of the subgroups. Four of the SSQ items load on two subscales instead of one, which inflate the contribution of these items on the total score. As two of these items, general discomfort and difficulty concentrating, are known to be correlated with anxiety,[ 30] this might have affected analysis.\r\n\r\nOnly two specific patient groups were included and all participants were relatively young; both these factors limit the generalizability of our findings. Also, this study examined state anxiety only, whereas additional affect states should be explored in future research. As a stable individual difference trait, anxiety is accounted for in the MEMORE model. However, as it can influence both the anxiety response and the CS symptoms, more research is required to clarify its potential role. Another limitation is that anxiety was measured with self-report. Finally, this study used the diagnostic criteria of the DSM-IV instead of the current DSM-V; however, as there are only marginal differences in the categories of psychotic disorders[ 39] the effect on the individual diagnosis of each patient in the present study can be considered negligible.\r\n\r\nClinical implications and future directions\r\n\r\nThis study indicates that caution is required when interpreting studies on both CS and anxiety, until the specificity in measurements has been improved. Gender differences in CS should also be taken into account. Findings on CS based on controls cannot be generalized to patients. Reported anxiety symptoms may partially reflect CS symptoms and vice versa. The relationship between VR exposure and CS symptoms is partially explained by anxiety as an intermediary variable. When VR therapy reduces anxiety, the nausea and disorientation symptoms are expected to decline. In addition, CS symptoms decrease after repetitive use of VR.[ 40] If a patient reports anxiety and CS during the first stages of VR treatment and can tolerate this, we recommend to continue with VR treatment.\r\n\r\nFuture research should include patients diagnosed with an anxiety disorder, and measure both state and trait anxiety. Replication with a larger sample size of a broad age range is necessary to be able to perform more detailed analysis of subgroups and further clarify mechanisms.\r\nEthical Standards\r\n\r\nThe authors assert that all procedures contributing to this work comply with the ethical standards of the relevant national and institutional committees on human experimentation and with the Declaration of Helsinki 1975, as revised in 2008.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by the Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (Veni 916.12.013 to W.V.).\r\nAuthor Disclosure Statement\r\n\r\nNo competing financial interests exist.\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n1 Valmaggia LR, Latif L, Kempton MJ, et al..

Using the results of a longitudinal study, we examined the effect of a new VRET strategy (Public Speech Trainer, PST), that incorporates 360° live recorded VR environments, on the reduction of public speaking anxiety. The PST was developed as a 360° smartphone application for a VR head-mounted device that participants could use at home. Realistic anxiety experiences were created by means of live 360° video recordings of a lecture hall containing three training sessions based on graded exposure framework; empty classroom (a) and with a small (b) and large audience (c). Thirty-five students participated in all sessions using PST. Anxiety levels were measured before and after each session over a period of 4 weeks. As expected, speaking anxiety significantly decreased after the completion of all PST sessions, and the decrement was the strongest in participants with initially high speaking anxiety baseline levels. Results also revealed that participants with moderate and high speaking anxiety baseline level differ in the anxiety state pattern over time. Conclusively and in line with habituation theory, the results supported the notion that VRET is more effective when aimed at reducing high-state anxiety levels. Further implications for future research and improvement of current VRET strategies are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]');

Unfortunately, few providers or patients have had access to the costly and technical equipment previously required. Recent technological advances in the form of consumer Virtual Reality (VR) systems (e.g. Oculus Rift and Samsung Gear), however, now make widespread use of VRET in clinical settings and as self-help applications possible. In this literature review, we detail the current state of VR technology and discuss important therapeutic considerations in designing self-help and clinician-led VRETs, such as platform choice, exposure progression design, inhibitory learning strategies, stimuli tailoring, gamification, virtual social learning and more. We illustrate how these therapeutic components can be incorporated and utilized in VRET applications, taking full advantage of the unique capabilities of virtual environments, and showcase some of these features by describing the development of a consumer-ready, gamified self-help VRET application for low-cost commercially available VR hardware. We also raise and discuss challenges in the planning, development, evaluation, and dissemination of VRET applications, including the need for more high-quality research. We conclude by discussing how new technology (e.g. eye-tracking) can be incorporated into future VRETs and how widespread use of VRET self-help applications will enable collection of naturalistic \"Big Data\" that promises to inform learning theory and behavioral therapy in general.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Virtual Reality; anxiety; fear; exposure therapy; self-help\r\nIntroduction\r\n\r\nAnxiety disorders are among the most common mental disorders, with lifetime prevalence estimates of roughly 29% (Kessler et al., [23]). Exposure therapy is a highly effective therapeutic strategy for many anxiety disorders, either as part of a comprehensive cognitive behavioral therapy program or even a stand-alone intervention (Norton & Price, [34]). Even so, there remains ample room for improvements in terms of both therapeutic efficacy and dissemination. For example, only half of cases with specific phobia will eventually make treatment contact, and among these, median delay from disorder onset to seeking treatment contact can be as high as 20 years (Wang et al., [55]). Even among initial treatment responders, return of fear is not uncommon, occurring in approximately 19–62% of cases (Vervliet, Craske, & Hermans, [54]).\r\n\r\nProviding traditional, in vivo exposure therapy is inherently associated with some practical and logistic issues for the clinician: the feared stimuli may be not be easily accessible (e.g. in fear of flying), difficult to acquire and maintain (e.g. keeping several spiders of different sizes regardless of season), or hard or impractical to manipulate and control during the exposure session (e.g. a public speaking audience). Research into using Virtual Reality (VR) technology to recreate phobic stimuli and conduct exposure therapy (VRET) began in the 1990s (Parsons & Rizzo, [41]). In essence, VR technology creates the experience of presence in a computer-generated environment by presenting an immersive, simulated visual and auditory experience, allowing user interactivity and by withholding sensory information from the real world. Most commonly, this is achieved through the use of a head-mounted display (HMD) that covers the eyes with optical lenses and two separate displays (one for each eye). By presenting slightly different views of the world on each display, the illusion of stereoscopic depth is created. Sensors track head movement and relay this to the computing unit, which updates the image on the displays corresponding to the movement of the user.\r\n\r\nVRET enables absolute control over the exposure stimuli, setting, and design, solving many of the logistic issues associated with traditional, in vivo exposure therapy. More than 20 RCTs of VRET show effect sizes comparable to those of in vivo exposure therapy (Opriş et al., [38]; Powers & Emmelkamp, [43]). Importantly, these effects are also observed on behavioral measures featuring in vivo stimuli (Morina, Ijntema, Meyerbröker, & Emmelkamp, [33]). Thus, VRET also reduces fear and anxiety when confronting equivalent real-world stimuli. However, a need for larger study samples and more precise estimates of treatment effects has been recognized (Page & Coxon, [40]). Still, the demonstrated efficacy of VRETs is remarkable considering the limitations of the hardware used to generate VR in past studies, with regard to both computing power and display technology. Over the last twenty years, consumer-level central and graphical processing units (CPUs and GPUs) have seen an exponential increase in computational power. In parallel, flat panel displays have seen a similar development in availability, size, resolution, and refresh rates. A chronological, non-systematic overview of the display resolutions and diagonal field-of-view of HMD devices used in various past VRET studies (Morina et al., [33]), as well as the contemporary HTC Vive and Samsung Gear VR systems, is shown in Figure 1.\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 1. Overview of display characteristics of VR HMD devices over time.\r\n\r\nLow display resolution, field-of-view and refresh rates, in combination with low computational power make the virtual environments generated by past generations of VR HMDs appear dramatically limited and antiquated by today\'s standards. Motion sickness (due to low display quality) and neck pains (due to the weight of the HMD) were also frequent issues with older HMD generations (Rebenitsch & Owen, [44]). Importantly, HMDs used to be inaccessible and expensive (often costing more than 10,000 USD), needed to be paired with equally expensive high-end computers, and required a high degree of technological expertise to install and operate. Equally obstructing for the progress of VRET development was the lack of experienced graphics designers and paid distribution mechanisms for VR content. This has now been facilitated by the means of widespread availability of fast Internet access and expansion in the highly valuable computer gaming industry. As a consequence, despite proven efficacy, until now, VRET has remained a gimmick reserved for well-funded researchers and specialized clinics, and has yet to fulfill its full clinical potential.\r\n\r\nThe spring of 2016 saw the release of the first generation of VR platforms targeted at consumers, developed by some of world\'s largest information technology companies. These platforms are expected to revolutionize how VR is used in general, and in this literature review, we discuss what this paradigm shift entails for the design and dissemination of VRETs specifically. We will use examples from the development of a gamified, self-help VRET application (designated VIMSE) for spider phobia we recently developed for the Samsung Gear VR platform which is being used in an ongoing randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing this VRET to traditional, in vivo one-session exposure therapy (Miloff et al., [31]). With this application, we will illustrate the possibilities and limitations of using the first generation of low-cost consumer VR platforms to create, validate and disseminate evidence-based VRETs. We will introduce clinicians and researchers to next-generation VRETs, raise and exemplify important design considerations in creating modern VRET applications, discuss how near-future hardware developments may be used for exposure purposes, and summarize important directions for future research. While recognizing that computer technology development is rapid and often unpredictable, we nonetheless believe that the design considerations outlined in this paper will remain relevant for the next several years. Although our focus will be on specific phobias, the same considerations generally apply for designing VRETs for social anxiety disorder (SAD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, and other anxiety disorders where the feared, anxiety-provoking stimuli can be simulated (or enhanced) in some manner in a virtual environment.\r\nDesign considerations\r\n\r\nPlatform choice: stationary or mobile\r\n\r\nAs of autumn 2016, VR platforms intended for the consumer market fall into two primary categories: stationary HMD\'s with integrated optics, displays and sensors that connect to a computer or gaming console that does the necessary computations (herein termed stationary VR; e.g. Oculus Rift and Playstation VR), or mobile platforms that rely on a simpler HMD featuring only lenses (and possibly additional sensors and an input device of some kind) that is combined with a smartphone that acts as display, sensor and processing unit (herein termed mobile VR; e.g. Samsung Gear VR). Platform choice should be considered early in the development since it has a substantial impact on target user and application design. Mobile VR platforms are portable and relatively inexpensive, making them suitable for developing and disseminating VRET self-help applications (such as VIMSE). Contemporary limitations include lower computational power, limited types of user-input (including types of head movements that can be registered), and no convenient way to share the virtual experience (i.e. to involve a therapist). Stationary VR platforms lack these limitations, yet cost more and also require physical connection to a high-end gaming computer (costing approximately 1500 USD) or a gaming console to run. While this presently makes stationary VR less suitable as a self-help tool, the additional costs associated with this platform type would typically not constitute a problem for use in clinics. Stationary VR platforms allow for the VR experience to be mirrored on an ordinary display that a clinician in the same room may use to direct the exposure context, controlling for example, the movement pattern of a virtual spider through some sort of interface, or simply monitoring how the user interacts with the stimuli (Bush, [ 7]; Rizzo et al., [45]).\r\nComputational limitations\r\n\r\nDespite unprecedented levels of computational power that far surpass that of previous hardware generations, hardware limitations will have to be considered to some extent, regardless of hardware platform. Technically, this is due to computational resources required to generate unique high-resolution (around 1080 × 1200 pixels) images for each eye with a fast (60 Hz) minimum refresh rate to prevent motion blur and sickness, along with real-time motion tracking and core application processes. In practice, this will impose restrictions as to the complexity of the virtual environment: the number of objects (spiders, traffic, audience members etc.), the resolution thereof (unique pixels), and the degree of interactivity of these objects (e.g. static, scripted movement of spiders or fully directed by user-gaze). There is some evidence to support the idea that added visual complexity might be beneficial for exposure purposes. For example, an animated audience has been shown to produce greater anxiety than a non-animated one in VRET for public speaking anxiety (Poeschl & Doering, [42]). Additionally, research has shown that the movement pattern of spiders is the most frightening aspect of their presentation (Davey, [11]), a finding suggesting that high graphical quality of non-critical exposure elements may not be required as long as the primary fear-provoking characteristic (e.g. movement) is perceived as realistic. In VIMSE, the processing capabilities of the smartphone used to power the Samsung Gear VR forced a prioritization of realistic movement, imposing some limitations as to the graphical quality of the virtual environment and the number of spiders that could be included in a given level.\r\n\r\nSpecial considerations apply when including human stimuli in VR environments, either as critical exposure elements (e.g. in VRET for social anxiety), background elements (e.g. in PTSD scenarios), or to facilitate role model learning (see section below). The so-called \"uncanny valley effect\" describes a well-documented phenomenon in digital settings in which comfort and familiarity with non-threatening human-like stimuli is generally positively correlated with the degree of human likeliness of the stimuli, except for in an interim interval wherein the stimulus is seen as human-enough, but not perfectly human, leading to a sudden dip in comfort or even evoking revulsion (Seyama & Nagayama, [51]). The phenomena, believed to be an effect of prediction errors triggered by conflicting perceptual categorical clues (Saygin, Chaminade, Ishiguro, Driver, & Frith, [49]), implies that any virtual human character with a prominent foreground presence and role should be made either only semi-realistic or near photorealistic, and not anything in-between.\r\nDevelopment environment\r\n\r\nPast VRETs have often relied on map editors and other built-in modification software integrated into popular computer games (e.g. Half-Life, Bouchard, Côté, St-Jacques, Robillard, & Renaud, [ 6]) to create the exposure contexts and tasks. This approach has two large advantages: ready-made, user-friendly interfaces lower development time and cost, while ensuring that graphical quality and environmental complexity is on par with standards set by the gaming industry. However, map editors and other software created for other purposes are likely to impose barriers in VRET design since they were not developed for this specific purpose. More recently, commercially available and accessible game engines such as the Unreal Engine, Unity (used to develop VIMSE), and Lumberyard offer practically unlimited control over all aspects of the design while remaining user-friendly and requiring only intermediate programming skills. As an additional benefit, end products can often be exported to multiple VR platforms. A final, pragmatic solution suitable for simpler VRET applications and VR experiments is to develop the application using experiment building software such as OpenSesame (Mathôt, Schreij, & Theeuwes, [28]) that offer support for specific VR platforms (e.g. the Oculus).\r\nTherapist-led or unguided self-help\r\n\r\nBecause previous generations of VR hardware have been so expensive and inaccessible, past VRETs have mimicked traditional exposure therapy in the sense that treatment took place on-site and together with a therapist that directed the exposure from a separate interface (Bush, [ 7]). However, with the arrival of consumer VR platforms, there is now the possibility to design VRET applications in a radically different way. VRET application may be designed to be used in-between in vivo treatment sessions (akin to blended Internet interventions (Andersson & Titov, [ 2]), or be designed and disseminated as freestanding unguided self-help. The VIMSE application was designed to be fully self-guided, requiring no therapist input. This was achieved by synthesizing the hierarchical progression system used in traditional exposure therapy, with a generic game design featuring levels and sub-levels, each with a gamified exposure task to be completed. A \"virtual therapist,\" in the form of a voice, is present to provide initial psychoeducation and encourage progression during the course of the session. The application also features a \"spider expert\" (a separate voice) who provides additional psychoeducation related to spiders. The \"virtual therapist\" was included in the VIMSE application since we hypothesized it to be an important therapeutic component; whether efficacy or compliance is truly increased by including a virtual therapist does however remain to be investigated.\r\nUser input\r\n\r\nSince all HMD devices track head rotation, gaze direction (or rather pseudo-gaze; see section below on eye-tracking) is the most natural and basic user-input modality. Gaze direction can be used in a similar way to a computer mouse to enable point-and-click navigation, for example, for selecting between available exposure tasks. In VIMSE, subjective units of distress are supplied at the beginning and end of exposure tasks by having the user select a number along a visual analog scale using their gaze and pressing a touchpad located on the HMD (see Figure 2(A)). Gaze input can also be used as the very basis for exposure tasks. In VIMSE, each level features an approach task where users follow advancing spiders with their gaze and if focus is diverted away from the spider, it turns back around, halting progression to the next level (see Figure 2(B)). This interactivity provides the user with a sense of control, similar to in vivo exposure therapy wherein the patient can choose to take a step back, and also allows rudimentary control over safety behaviors such as shutting one\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 2. Screenshots from the VIMSE application.\r\n\r\nIn addition to gaze, some VR platforms also support input such as gamepads and motion controllers enabling the user to move around in first person, so-called first-person locomotion. To date, there is no research showing that this is therapeutically superior to having virtual objects (e.g. spiders) move while the subject remains stationary (the design used in VIMSE). Further, research suggests that movement in the virtual environment, which increases input discrepancy between sensory organs, is a strong contributor to VR-induced nausea and other cybersickness symptoms (Rebenitsch & Owen, [44]). Thus, even with next-generation hardware, developers should consider whether first-person movement in the virtual environment is necessary, or whether the task can be adequately redesigned for stationary subjects and moving objects. The need for user movement may differ by disorders: in acrophobia, for example, being able to voluntarily move toward a virtual ledge likely has therapeutic effects. In spider phobia, where the covert invasion of personal space by the spider is often a key component of fear, it may even be beneficial to have the user stationary since it likely strengthens the fear response. Regardless, there is great potential in using handheld controllers (as found on the current HTC Vive) or cameras for motion tracking to realistically recreate arm movements in the virtual world. Typically, physically touching a spider constitutes a large threshold for phobic patients, making it a key therapeutic step in traditional exposure therapy, the virtual equivalent of which so far has been inaccessible to all but a few with access to sophisticated laboratory technology.\r\nDesign of exposure therapy components\r\n\r\nHierarchical progression and tailoring the experience\r\n\r\nTraditional exposure therapy usually begins with a careful behavior analysis and the creation of a fear hierarchy used to guide progression of exposures tasks (Ollendick & Davis, [36]). Progression, in essence, is an ordered variation of different fear-relevant aspects of the stimuli. One of the advantages of VRET is that this variation can go well beyond what can be achieved in real life. In addition to parameters such as size, type, color, distance etc., VRET designers may opt to vary the degree of realism and specify detailed stimuli behavior. In VIMSE, the first step in the exposure hierarchy features a blue, smiling and non-threatening spider wearing a helmet and pink slippers, ensuring that even severely phobic users can accomplish the first exposure task (seen in Figure 2(A) and (B)).\r\n\r\nIn traditional exposure therapy, a large emphasis is placed on disproving individual catastrophic thoughts. We are not aware of any research systematically investigating how tailored the virtual phobic stimuli or exposure tasks need to be to the individual\'s idiosyncratic fear in order to evoke an adequate fear response, or the subsequent impact on treatment outcomes. This should be considered an important topic for future research since it will provide guidelines for advanced development work. Interfaces used to enable therapists to control individual stimuli and events during VRET therapy have been developed for previous applications (Rizzo et al., [45]); however, the resources required to develop and implement such an interface must be taken into account during the design phase. The resources required will likely be proportional to the complexity of what is to be tailored, from relatively easy (e.g. allowing tailoring of color or size of an animal) to very difficult (e.g. tailoring PTSD combat or sexual assault scenarios).\r\nMonitor and discourage safety behaviors\r\n\r\nIn traditional exposure therapy, therapists monitor and correct subtle in-session safety behaviors such as backing away from a phobic stimulus, closing one\'s eyes, etc. (Levy & Radomsky, [27]). In VRET, real-time monitoring and interactive feedback can be made part of the exposure task, as in the above-mentioned VIMSE level design requiring open eyes to direct a spider, and thereby mitigating safety behaviors. VRET also has the potential to introduce unique safety behaviors, for example, patients convincing themselves that the virtual audience does not behave in a realistic manner. In our experience however, safety behaviors such as these can be countered with appropriate, complementary cognitive therapy components, for example, emphasizing that only the patient\'s fear response needs to be real, not the response provocation. Interestingly, recent in vivo exposure research suggested that judicious use of some safety behaviors may not only increase treatment acceptability rates, but can also have therapeutic effects by facilitating approach behaviors (Levy & Radomsky, [26]). More research on the negative impact, and therapeutic potential of VR specific safety behaviors is needed.\r\nPsychoeducation\r\n\r\nJust as VR is increasingly being used in classic educational settings to provide a more immersive learning experience (Mikropoulos & Natsis, [30]), so too can the psychoeducational component of exposure therapy be enhanced by using engrossing VR material. In VIMSE, the initial psychoeducation step takes place in a virtual therapist office (see Figure 2(C)) where a behavioral view on fear, anxiety, and phobic avoidance is presented in an appropriate context through diagrams and the voice of the virtual therapist.\r\nSocial model learning\r\n\r\nConditioning research has revealed that humans are very efficient in learning fear acquisition and extinction by observing others (Olsson & Phelps, [37]), so-called social, observational or model learning. In traditional exposure therapy, having the patient observe the therapist perform the exposure behaviors themselves without displaying a phobic reaction is believed to be an important, powerful therapeutic component (Öst, [39]). We are not aware of any study that has incorporated explicit observational extinction learning into VRETs. This is likely due to the previously high computational and programming costs of realistically modeling a virtual role model in the environment, or the challenges of merging video and animated content. However, given the wealth of basic and clinical research demonstrating the benefits of including observational extinction learning, we believe that incorporating and examining this component is an important next step for novel VRET applications.\r\nGamification\r\n\r\nThe use of gamification techniques, defined as the addition of explicit game-playing elements such as level-style progression, points, rewards, goals, and feedback in non-game contexts (Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, & Nacke, [12]; Johnson et al., [22]), is a promising addition to the development of modern VRET applications (Botella et al., [ 4]). Games are inherently motivating and gamification has been found to promote positive experiences of engagement and enjoyment (Hamari, Koivisto, & Sarsa, [18]). Games are thus powerful tools for facilitating new learning, providing a structured way of harnessing the power of a fun experience, invoking relaxation and enabling hard effort without resentment. In the context of VRET, which can be highly distressing for patients, gamification may reduce the negative experiences of treatment. Gamified open-ended scenarios that can be played regularly may increase the likelihood of continuing to confront aversive stimuli even after treatment, reducing the risk of return of fear. Nevertheless, effort must be made to ensure games do not distract from the therapeutic goals of exposure therapy. In order to ensure effectiveness, games must take into account the culture, gender, and socioeconomic status of participants (Goh, Ang, & Tan, [17]), as well as their age group. In VIMSE, each level was designed to include a gamified exposure task. In the example shown in Figure 2(D), the user is tasked with helping a spider climb a wall by keeping rain from washing the spider down. This is achieved by maneuvering an umbrella and following the spider\'s movement by keeping gaze focused at the spider.\r\nDisorder-specific considerations\r\n\r\nThe complete stimuli control offered by VRETs means that the inherent, unique characteristics of each anxiety provoking stimuli can and should guide the design of the exposure therapy. In designing VRET applications for anxiety disorders that involve an obvious, external fear-provoking stimulus, i.e. specific phobias, SAD, agoraphobia, PTSD and OCD conditions related to a specific situation (e.g. leaving a door unlocked), the phobic stimulus needs to be realistically recreated with some graded variation. Again, VRET developers should take full advantage of the possibility to vary the stimuli and task design in ways not possible in in vivo exposure therapy (e.g. realism). More complex stimuli will be harder to recreate, execute, and tailor. For example, considering the computational power required to create and realistically render an interactive crowd for public speaking exposure scenarios, it is not surprising that most past research on VRET has been on specific phobias with simpler stimuli such as flight phobia, animal phobia, and acrophobia (Powers & Emmelkamp, [43]).\r\n\r\nFor other anxiety conditions, it may be sufficient to merely virtually recreate the anxiety trigger, or to enhance the in sensu (imagined) experience. One past VRET study on panic disorder reported good treatment results by simulating bodily triggers in the form of rapid heartbeats and dizziness in a virtual setting (Botella et al., [ 5]). This approach does of course require that the virtual trigger is powerful and immersive enough to evoke interoceptive sensations. Worrying, the defining characteristics of generalized anxiety disorder, can be viewed as a cognitive-verbal avoidant behavior that hinders full exposure to aversive emotional processing (Hoyer et al., [20]); congruently, in sensu exposure therapy for worry is effective even as a stand-alone treatment (Andersson et al., [ 1]). Future VRET applications may be designed to either fully mimic common worry-evoking scenarios (e.g. the funeral of a loved one), or to simply enhance the experience of concurrent in sensu exposure by immersive viewing of e.g. photos of loved ones and death-related imagery. The latter would be easier to design, program, and customize for each patient, yet the added benefit of this over traditional, in sensu worry exposure remains to be tested, as is the feasibility of fully simulating personalized worry-evoking scenarios.\r\nIncorporating novel exposure strategies\r\n\r\nExperimental and clinical research on fear extinction has questioned the long-held assumption of classic exposure therapy that habituation, i.e. a decrease in physiological and psychological distress through prolonged exposure to a feared stimulus, is required for the reduction of fear (Craske et al., [ 9]). Several studies contrasting exposure therapies based on habituation vs. inhibitory learning have shown an added efficacy of the latter (e.g. Baker et al., [ 3]). Craske and coworkers have proposed several strategies to maximize inhibitory learning and resulting fear extinction (Craske, Treanor, Conway, Zbozinek, & Vervliet, [10]), and we argue that VRET is particularly suitable to incorporate some of these promising strategies.\r\n\r\nThe inhibitory learning approach emphasizes maximizing violation of expectancy, i.e. having the patient remain in an exposure scenario until belief in an expected, feared outcome is near zero, regardless of habituation. In VRET applications, which offer complete stimuli control, this can with relative ease be made an automated feature beginning with the user grading their belief in common (or tailored) expected outcomes prior to an exposure task, having the opposite occur and not allowing progression until the user supplies expectancy or belief strength ratings below a pre-set limit. A related, novel exposure strategy is occasional reinforcing of fear learning, which involves re-introducing occasional pairings of conditioned stimuli (e.g. spider) and unconditioned aversive event, for example, by occasionally manipulating the stimuli to become more threatening (e.g. have spiders attack). This strategy likely acts by introducing additional expectancy violations and can be incorporated into VRET applications in the same automated, tailored manner.\r\n\r\nSeveral other new strategies rely on varying the stimuli, environment, or design to maximize inhibitory learning, which can easily be accomplished in VRET due to the nearly limitless possibilities inherent in the technology. Conducting exposures while varying the stimuli (e.g. having many different spiders) and context (e.g. a virtual living room, shed, outdoors etc.) has been shown to improve generalizability of extinction learning, decreasing the risk of return of fear outside the therapy session (Craske et al., [10]; Vervliet et al., [54]). Contrary to classic exposure therapy that relies on hierarchical fear scenario progression, the inhibitory learning approach encourages progression to occur in an almost random order in order to maintain high psychological and physiological arousal, rather than habituation and reduced interest, diminishing the salience of stimuli. In VRET, the stimuli can be shifted (with endless variation) without any delay, for example, moving from the second to tenth floor in acrophobia treatment, or shifting between a house spider and a tarantula. Offering users the ability to \"pause\" or \"slow-motion\" the exposure at any time (i.e. immediate removal of the feared stimuli, similar to the feature found in computer games) will likely increase the sense of control and reduce rates of treatment refusal. This feature (\"pausing\") was incorporated into VIMSE, enjoyed appreciation by users, and in our experience was not used as a safety behavior. Future research should investigate whether \"pausing\" or \"slow-motion\" features can in fact be used as therapeutic safety behaviors that increase approach behaviors (Levy & Radomsky, [26], [27]). Finally, so-called deepened extinction involves exposure to multiple stimuli that have previously been extinguished separately. In VIMSE, effort was made to incorporate this feature by presenting several different spiders from past levels together.\r\nChallenges in VRET development, evaluation, and dissemination\r\n\r\nModern game engines (most of which are available free of charge for non-commercial purposes) allow VRET developers to populate a virtual world with 3D objects and determine any behavior or function using a visual or text based scripting language, with only intermediate skill and experience required. These typically have built-in asset stores featuring pre-made environments, animated characters, services, textures etc. that can be acquired by developers and integrated into any project, allowing developers to focus on core application design rather than generating objects, textures, and animations themselves. Modern game engines have thus significantly reduced the technical threshold required to create VRET applications and there is extensive support available in the form of tutorials and online forums. However, creating VR experiences on par with the games industry will typically require a full team of skill sets specialized on different aspects of development.\r\n\r\nMeta-analyses on RCTs show that while VRET has large treatment effects (Morina et al., [33]; Opriş et al., [38]; Powers & Emmelkamp, [43]), study quality is often sub-par compared to research on other behavioral interventions (McCann et al., [29]; Page & Coxon, [40]). If VRET is to be considered for integration into regular health care settings alongside other psychological treatments, RCT quality needs to be improved, including the systematic reporting of negative effects (Rozental, Kottorp, Boettcher, Andersson, & Carlbring, [48]). The dramatic increase in hardware and software availability, and increased public acquaintance with the technology, will hopefully enable larger sample sizes with higher external validity in RCTs. Interview studies have shown that both therapists and patients tend to be positively inclined toward using VRET in clinical settings (Segal, Bhatia, & Drapeau, [50]), although there are unique VR concerns such as acquiring and operating the necessary equipment, risks with both hyper- and hypo-immersion (Kramer et al., [24]; Kramer, Savary, Pyne, Kimbrell, & Jegley, [25]), in addition to concerns common to all types of exposure therapy (Olatunji, Deacon, & Abramowitz, [35]). Initial research also suggests that majority of patients may prefer VRET over traditional exposure therapy, seemingly due to a belief that in vivo exposure will be too frightening (Garcia-Palacios, Botella, Hoffman, & Fabregat, [14]; Garcia-Palacios, Hoffman, See, Tsai, & Botella, [16]). With the advent of commercial VR hardware and shrinking resources required to develop user-friendly software, the technical concerns should no longer present such a barrier to implementing VRET in clinical settings. Again, as the general population becomes more accustomed to using VR in other aspects of their lives (gaming, viewing movies, virtual visits to other locations, etc.), conducting exposure therapy using VR will seem more natural to both clinicians and patients.\r\n\r\nUnguided VRET self-help applications intended for commercial distribution, of which there are very few available at time of writing, should ideally also be subject to scientific evaluation; historical analogs, unfortunately, suggest this will not be the case (Rosen, [46]). For example, reviews of commercially available self-help smartphone applications for depression treatment have shown that a large majority of these applications are poorly described and of questionable utility (Huguet et al., [21]; Shen et al., [52]). Due to the presence of a well-developed, readily available infrastructure for spreading smartphone and computer applications through digital marketplaces, there is a great potential of disseminating VRET self-help applications to unprecedented number of individuals with anxiety (and other) disorders. To some degree, public user-rating systems may mitigate the issue of low-quality commercial VRET applications available on digital marketplaces.\r\nFuture directions\r\n\r\nIn addition to increased computational power allowing improvements in the complexity and interactivity of virtual exposure scenarios, there are several readily available or soon to be introduced user-input technologies that will exponentially increase the realism of what can be achieved in the virtual environment. In our experience studying VIMSE, the lack of simulated physical contact with a spider hindered high-level fear extinction for many participants. Several consumer VR HMDs support motion controllers that make it possible for users to have hand interaction in the virtual environments, for example, virtually reaching toward a spider or giving oneself a needle injection. Haptic feedback in the form of vibrations (similar to that found in popular game controllers) may further increase the immersive experience. Incorporating physiological instruments (e.g. pulse and skin conductance) into handheld controllers would allow the VRET application to adapt the exposure scenario and stimuli to this objective input and present researchers with valuable, naturalistically collected data. Similarly, physical movement tracking through cameras, as featured in several modern VR platforms, will allow users to literarily walk around in the virtual environment in a realistic and immersive manner, for example, giving participants with acrophobia the opportunity to walk toward a ledge and look down. They will also allow physical objects placed in the environment, for example a stuffed tarantula, to have a virtual presence mapped to its physical location, a method shown to increase therapeutic efficacy in a past study (Hoffman, Garcia-Palacios, Carlin, Furness III, & Botella-Arbona, [19]). Finally, eye tracking, i.e. measurement of the point of gaze by cameras integrated into the HMD, will offer substantially improved precision as compared to head movement tracking. This too may prove useful in providing researchers with naturalistically collected data, and may also allow better control of safety behaviors such as looking away or closing eyes. Eye tracking may be particularly beneficial in cases of SAD by enabling a patient to meet the gaze of a simulated avatar in VR space.\r\n\r\nWhile these technological advances promise to enable more advanced exposure techniques, perhaps the greatest revolution that will be made possible by next generation VRET involves the ability to collect, analyze, and make use of unprecedented amounts of data, i.e. bringing exposure therapy into the age of \"Big Data psychology\" (Mitroff et al., [32]). With such a high population prevalence of anxiety disorders and subclinical fears and anxiety, there is large potential user base for VRET applications enabling analysis of sample sizes beyond even the largest RCT. So-called A/B testing, akin to blinded randomized allocation of users to different experiences during actual product use, is already standard practice in consumer research, and this method would give researchers the tools and the sample size to investigate the impact of even minor changes in exposure strategies. Big data, combined with machine learning algorithms capable of automatically identifying patterns and statistically predicting outcomes, will also provide the opportunity to continuously increase efficacy. This may be done at an individual level, for example by learning which specific types of stimuli evoke fear in a specific user and tailoring future scenarios accordingly or at an application level by omitting the least effective exposure scenarios. Importantly, assuming that VRET applications have properly implemented the procedures used in canonical exposure therapy, the big data acquired from self-help VRET applications would also prove valuable to behavioral learning theory in general, as well as informing traditional exposure therapy.\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nWhile having been researched for decades and proven efficacious for the treatment of anxiety disorders, the pending and ongoing release of consumer-targeted VR hardware platforms signals an opportune time to develop the next generation of VR exposure therapies for widespread dissemination as self-help applications and integration into regular health care settings. A number of key success factors for this new wave of VRETs are summarized in Table 1. In this literature review, we have discussed some of the design considerations, both technical and therapeutic, in creating and disseminating a new wave of VRETs, including how to take advantage of the unique possibilities offered by VR technology to do things not possible in and with traditional in vivo exposure therapy. Although more research is needed in several areas, we argue that this next generation of VRET has great potential to make a significant contribution to decreasing the global burden of anxiety disorders.\r\n\r\nTable 1.

The smartphone and gaming industries are well-funded, innovative, standard-setting and their product platforms accessible and ubiquitous\r\nMaking use of the unique features of VR, not simply recreating traditional in vivo stimuli in a virtual environment	Traditional exposure therapy is not a perfect product and some of the unique features enabled by VR technology promises to increase efficacy even further. Stimuli can be modified, incorporated in a plurality of variations, and tailored to the specific client in a manner not possible in vivo. Some approaches to VRET (e.g. self-help platforms) will likely require adaption (e.g. gamification to decrease attrition)\r\nExploring the VRET self-help format enabled by consumer VR platforms, including \"Big data\" possibilities	Self-help VRET applications could dramatically increase the availability and dissemination of evidence-based treatments, decreasing the prevalence of anxiety disorders. \"Big data\" on the mechanisms of exposure therapy would have great value not just in improving self-help applications, but would also inform learning therapy and traditional exposure therapy\r\nUsing observational fear extinction learning to enhance VRET efficacy	Observational learning is a powerful method to enhance extinction learning and an integral part of traditional exposure therapy, but has yet to be fully implemented in VRETs due to limitations of past hardware and software\r\nUsing inhibitory learning exposure strategies to enhance VRET efficacy	Exposure strategies focused on maximizing inhibitory learning promises to increase efficacy and can easily be incorporated into VRET applications since these offer complete control over the virtual environment (stimuli, context and design)\r\nAdopt and explore the possibilities enabled by new VR-related hardware, such as hand motion sensors, eye-tracking, etc.	Any novel technologies designed by the gaming industry to increase immersion and enjoyment can likely be used for the same purposes (and others) in VRET\r\nAdopt same intervention evaluation standards used for other behavioral interventions	If VRET is to be integrated into regular health care services, there is a need for more well-powered, high-quality randomized controlled trials evaluating efficacy and effectiveness according to the standards applied to other behavioral interventions\r\n\r\nDisclosure statement\r\n\r\nAuthor WH is the founder and research officer of Mimerse, a private company that developed the VIMSE application mentioned in the current article, a consumer version of which is now available for purchase.

Consequently, there is a clear need for objective and standardized tools. Virtual reality (VR) can be used to achieve controlled symptom provocation, which allows direct assessment for the clinician. We developed a video VR game to provoke and assess obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms in a standardized and controlled environment. The first objective was to evaluate if the VR game is capable of provoking symptoms in OCD patients as opposed to healthy controls. The second objective was to evaluate the tolerability of the VR game in OCD patients. The VR game was created using a first-person perspective and confronted patients with 15 OCD-specific items, while simultaneously measuring OCD symptoms, including the number of compulsions, anxiety, tension, uncertainty, and urge to control. In this pilot study, eight patients and eight healthy controls performed the VR game. OCD patients performed significantly more compulsions ( U = 5, p = 0.003) during the VR game. The anxiety, tension, uncertainty, and urge to control in response to the specific items were also higher for OCD patients, although significance was not yet reached because of the small sample. There were no substantial adverse effects. The results of this pilot study indicate that the VR game is capable of provoking a variety of OCD symptoms in OCD patients, as opposed to healthy controls, and is a potential valuable tool to objectify and standardize an OCD diagnosis.

With virtual reality (VR), computer-generated interactive environments, individuals can repeatedly experience their problematic situations and be taught, via evidence-based psychological treatments, how to overcome difficulties. VR is moving out of specialist laboratories. Our central aim was to describe the potential of VR in mental health, including a consideration of the first 20 years of applications. A systematic review of empirical studies was conducted. In all, 285 studies were identified, with 86 concerning assessment, 45 theory development, and 154 treatment. The main disorders researched were anxiety (n = 192), schizophrenia (n = 44), substancerelated disorders (n = 22) and eating disorders (n = 18). There are pioneering early studies, but the methodological quality of studies was generally low. The gaps in meaningful applications to mental health are extensive. The most established finding is that VR exposure-based treatments can reduce anxiety disorders, but there are numerous research and treatment avenues of promise. VR was found to be a much-misused term, often applied to non-interactive and non-immersive technologies. We conclude that VR has the potential to transform the assessment, understanding and treatment of mental health problems. The treatment possibilities will only be realized if - with the user experience at the heart of design - the best immersive VR technology is combined with targeted translational interventions. The capability of VR to simulate reality could greatly increase access to psychological therapies, while treatment outcomes could be enhanced by the technology\'s ability to create new realities. VR may merit the level of attention given to neuroimaging. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

However, there is limited understanding of what factors affect presence in virtual environments. This study uses a qualitative methodology, specifically thematic analysis, to investigate factors affecting sense of presence in a VR social environment that has been designed for psychological assessment. After experiencing a virtual bar-room that contained interactions with multiple avatars, participants (n = 76) took part in a semistructured interview. Eight key themes and associated subthemes were identified: emotions about self (anxiety, paranoid ideation, and detachment), emotions about others (loneliness, retrospective emotions, and recognition of self), thoughts about self (memories and social judgment), thoughts about others (paranoid ideation and narrative), physiological reactions (anxiety and cybersickness), behavior of avatars (narrative, duration of interaction, and characteristics), interactivity with environment (movement and familiarity), and environmental characteristics (restrictions). Sense of presence was facilitated when the VR elicited genuine cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses, and when participants created their own narrative about events. Presence decreased when participants experienced diminished agency and experienced physical impediments, such as cybersickness and awareness of apparatus and body movement. Strengths of the study include rich data generated by the qualitative approach and the large sample size. Limitations include lack of follow-up measuring longer-term effects.

To answer this question, a meta-review was conducted to assess the meta-analyses and systematic and narrative reviews published in this field in the last twenty-two months. Twenty-five different articles demonstrated the clinical potential of this technology in both the diagnosis and the treatment of mental health disorders: VR compares favorably to existing treatments in anxiety disorders, eating and weight disorders, and pain management, with long-term effects that generalize to the real world. But why is VR so effective? Here, the following answer is suggested: VR shares with the brain the same basic mechanism: embodied simulations. According to neuroscience, to regulate and control the body in the world effectively, the brain creates an embodied simulation of the body in the world used to represent and predict actions, concepts, and emotions. VR works in a similar way: the VR experience tries to predict the sensory consequences of an individual\'s movements, providing to him/her the same scene he/she will see in the real world. To achieve this, the VR system, like the brain, maintains a model (simulation) of the body and the space around it. If the presence in the body is the outcome of different embodied simulations, concepts are embodied simulations, and VR is an embodied technology, this suggests a new clinical approach discussed in this article: the possibility of altering the experience of the body and facilitating cognitive modeling/change by designing targeted virtual environments able to simulate both the external and the internal world/body.

We could show that virtual stimuli in a common, domestic family environment led to a significant increase in perceived stress as measured by quantitative (self-reports) and qualitative (semi-structured interviews analysed with a General Inductive Approach (GIA)) responses. The results also showed that the introduction of virtual stimuli induced significantly higher levels of perceived workload and sense of presence and led to different physiological reactions. These findings have implications for the design and implementation of non-immersive VR systems.\r\n\r\nKeywords: Virtual Reality; stress; virtual stimuli; exposure; sense of presence\r\n1. Introduction\r\n\r\nFor most of us, standing at the edge of a high cliff is an uncomfortable, even stressful experience. We might get sweaty hands, our heart rate (HR) goes up, we can hardly concentrate on anything else than mastering this situation, and we might even start to panic. These responses to a stressful situation help us to survive or at least to keep us out of danger most of the times. However, some people develop fears which are so severe that they interfere with their normal life and therefore they need help (North, North, and Coble [41]). Mental health professionals often use an adjunct Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) approach (Krijn et al. [33]). In VRET, clients are exposed to fearful or stress-evoking virtual stimuli to develop coping strategies for real-life situations (Wiederhold, Bullinger, and Wiederhold [65]). There is an extensive body of research showing that those specific virtual stimuli actually lead to equivalent psychological responses for users (Mühlberger et al. [39]), for instance, eliciting anxiety (e.g. Pertaub, Slater, and Barker [45]; Hartanto et al. [24]; Seinfeld et al. [54]), stress (e.g. Slater et al. [57]; Stetz et al. [61]), and fears (e.g. Diemer et al. [17]; McCall et al. [35]). Apparently, virtual stressors are as effective as real-life stimuli in those extreme situations.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when playing highly immersive computer games, people are seeking the experience of stressful situations (amongst other forms of experiences) by getting stimulated with the virtual stressors presented in the games. Those stimuli include dark, claustrophobic spaces, (virtual) life-threatening game characters such as monsters, and, again, high cliffs or dangerous animals, such as spiders (e.g. McCall et al. [35]).\r\n\r\nHighly immersive computer games and VRET use similar stimulation techniques to evoke certain psychological responses, such as stress. There are even situations where computer games are used for VRET focusing on significant life changes or scenarios associated with major life events, like with post-traumatic stress disorder research (e.g. Difede and Hoffman [18]; Rizzo et al. [48]; Rizzo et al. [49]); fear of spiders (Garcia-Palacios et al. [21]); fear of cockroaches (e.g. Botella et al. [ 9]); fear of heights (e.g. Krijn et al. [32]); fear of flying (Rothbaum et al. [51]); and fear of public speaking/social phobia (e.g. Botella et al. [ 8]).\r\n\r\nHowever, life is more than just being in specific and extreme situations: at cliffs, at war, in jungles full of spiders, or fighting armed monsters. What about everyday events which make us feel stressed? The too-many-things-at-once situations, the noisy neighbourhood, or our children playing with lighters or knives? While there is no doubt that those situations make us feel stressed in real life (Kanner et al. [28]; Crnic and Greenberg [14]; Kohn and Macdonald [31]), it is unclear whether virtual, everyday stressors would elicit actual stress responses. Are virtual stressors only effective for specialised or extreme situations or will they work for everyday situations as well?\r\n\r\nIn addition, if those virtual stressors are presented in a highly immersive system, for example, by utilising head-mounted displays (HMDs) or surrounding stereo projections, there is little doubt that this immersive experience can lead to actually perceived stress. But, is that true for the more widely used class of virtual reality (VR) systems utilising just a monitor screen? Those non-immersive systems are readily available, are familiar to most people, and are less prone to evoke stress or other emotional responses by their sheer appearance. For example, when putting on a HMD or entering a CAVE, this act in itself will provoke reactions, at least for first-time or occasional users.\r\n\r\nKrijn et al. ([33]) point out that \' ... VRET should be distinguished from different forms of treatments [...] [for instance] computer-assisted vicarious exposure\'. The latter would use a 2D screen but not necessarily a 3D virtual environment (on screen), like in the system suggested and presented in this paper here. They also point out that \'Research is needed to compare VRET with these other computer-mediated treatments\'. Our work addresses this by presenting a non-immersive, but nevertheless VR system to be used to evoke psychological responses of stress.\r\n\r\nIf we can show if and how mild everyday stimuli presented in a common, non-immersive VR system can elicit actual stress responses, then this will influence our decisions on the design of virtual environments, either to avoid stressful experiences for our users or to provide such experiences like in (casual) VR games. Also, would virtually evoked stress responses lead to higher workload and a higher sense of presence for the users? While the higher perceived workload would just confirm our common-sense judgement, a higher sense of presence means that the virtual environment is perceived as a virtual world. A perceived sense of presence is a defining element of VR (Slater [56]).\r\n\r\nBased on a scenario around an everyday, domestic family environment, we present a study which shows a positive, significant relationship between virtual, everyday emotional stimuli and stress responses. We also show that workload and presence are significantly affected.\r\n\r\nTo the best of our knowledge, this research is the first of its kind to demonstrate a relationship between non-extreme, non-specialised, virtual, everyday situations and stress responses; workload measures; and a perceived sense of being in a virtual environment (sense of presence) with a non-immersive VR system.\r\n2. Related work\r\n\r\n2.1. Virtual reality\r\n\r\nVR combines three-dimensionality, real-time computer graphics, and interactivity in a way that users feel being part of that environment. VR can appear in a variety of forms depending on the hardware and software being used (Krijn et al. [33]), ranging from non-immersive desktop-monitor systems to so-called CAVE installations, which are highly immersive, mainly due to the surroundedness of the users.\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of a virtual environment depends on several elements. The sense of being part of the environment is a defining element. This sense of presence has been investigated and studied by many researchers (e.g. Heeter [25]; Loomis [34]; Sheridan [55]; Barfield et al. [ 3]), and it can be defined as \'the subjective experience of being in one place or environment [e.g. virtual environment], even when one is physically situated in another\' (Witmer and Singer [66], 225); or as \'a state of consciousness, the (psychological) sense of being in the virtual environment\' (Slater and Wilbur [59], 4). High levels of presence that users experience in the VR environment should make them perceive this environment as a more engaging reality than the surrounding physical world, and consider the environment as a place they have visited rather than just images they have seen (Slater and Wilbur [59]). Thus, participants\' behaviours in this VR environment should be consistent with those that would have occurred in real life under similar circumstances (Slater and Wilbur [59]).\r\n\r\nNormally, a higher immersive system would lead to higher levels of perceived sense of presence and, therefore, would lead to stronger psychological reactions. Whether less immersive systems are effective in that sense mainly depends on the modes and levels of interactivity and on the architecture and narrative of the virtual environment (Regenbrecht [46]).\r\n2.2. VR and evoking psychological reactions\r\n\r\nUsers can be emotionally affected by virtual environments, even though they know these environments are not real (Walshe et al. [64]). There has been research showing that in particular immersive VR environments or stimuli can induce (strong) emotional and psychological reactions in users (Meehan et al. [37]). For example, Meehan et al. ([36]) conducted experiments to examine and compare users\' physiological reactions when exposed to a non-threatening virtual environment compared with a threatening, stressful one. Their results revealed that a response/change in HR resulted from the VR exposure. González-Franco et al. ([22]) used a scenario where a group of participants observed an attack on their virtual body by a knife in an immersive virtual environment. These are examples of extreme and specific situations. Or, for instance, McCall et al. ([35]) studied arousal, which is a subjective feeling with strong physiological correlates. During the study, they immersed participants in a threatening VR environment (\'Room 101\'). Participants were confronted with a series of fearful events such as facing many spiders (crawling down the walls and the ceiling), scary ambient noise (sounds of footsteps and gunshots), blood appearing on the walls and across the view, and several explosions destroying the ground. One of their results showed that this fearful environment was successful in eliciting physiological responses (HR and skin conductance).\r\n\r\nA number of studies have shown that virtual human avatars can elicit a type of fear or anxiety similar to what people may experience in real-life social situations (Slater, Pertaub, and Steed [58]; Pertaub, Slater, and Barker [44]; Pertaub, Slater, and Barker [45]; Garau et al. [20]; Slater et al. [57]).\r\n\r\nSome previous research have suggested that there is a link between presence and emotions in VR (Pallavicini et al. [42]). Emotions such as fear, anxiety, or stress perceived during immersion were found to be related to presence (Bouchard et al. [10]). Regenbrecht, Schubert, and Friedmann ([47]) and Schuemie et al. ([53]) found significant associations between the level of fear experienced during immersion and presence. This is supported by Michaud et al. ([38]) and Bouchard et al. ([10]) who performed experiments manipulating the levels of presence and then examining its influence on anxiety. A comprehensive review of perception and perception on emotional reactions, in particular fears, can be found in Diemer et al. ([16]). She and her colleagues developed a new attribution model for presence, including the identification of gaps in research.\r\n\r\nResearch in the application of non-immersive virtual environments on psychological responses is less numerous, but promising.\r\n\r\nA study by Klinger et al. ([29]) could show that cognitive behaviour therapy to treat social phobias administered traditionally and using a PC-based VR system showed similar effects. Here, participants sat in front of a large monitor and navigated in the virtual environment using a mouse, arrow keys, or a cyberpuck – a non-immersive set-up, but with specific, clinical stimuli.\r\n\r\nThe effects of non-immersive VR on phobic (clinical) and non-phobic (healthy control subjects) were investigated by Robillard et al. ([50]), showing that anxiety and presence only developed for the phobic participants and that there is a relationship between presence and anxiety. Apparently, exposing people to a non-immersive virtual environment can lead to psychological responses, but this study is leaving the question unanswered whether this also works for non-phobic stimuli and for non-phobic users.\r\n\r\nBaños et al. ([ 2]) addressed the level of immersion on presence mediated by emotional elements in the virtual environment. Both immersion and affective content have an impact on presence, but immersion was more relevant for non-emotional versus emotional environments. Hence, it is left unanswered whether a non-immersive system (less immersion) can elicit (sufficient) psychological responses.\r\n\r\nWhile there is a host of research into VRET, predominantly immersive, but also non- and semi-immersive, and while there is some research in non-immersive virtual exposure with specific stimuli, there seems to be no or only little research into rather common, mild virtual stimuli in non-immersive, desktop-monitor environments.\r\n\r\nWe are utilising a non-specific, non-clinical, common scenario to investigate this gap in research. Our scenario of postnatal parenting is well defined and with this can be rigorously studied, while at the same time it is common enough to allow for generalisations towards other applications.\r\n\r\nOur research is motivated by requests from research and practice in mental health, in particular in addressing postnatal stress and depression, and on how VR can be used to minimise negative experiences after a child is born for the parents. We opted for not tackling the clinical nature of this topic, but rather for taking parenthood as an omnipresent situation worth to serve as an example for our research.\r\n2.3. Parenting of very young children\r\n\r\nFor this targeted scenario situated in a domestic family environment, children play a vital role in experiencing such an environment, including developing stressful responses, in particular in the postnatal period, which is a critical time for every parent, especially a mother. During this time, several daily stressors and emotional challenges typically arise.\r\n\r\nMost families and parents typically face daily frustrating and difficult events/tasks from child-bearing and caregiving demands (Crnic and Greenberg [14]). For some parents, particularly those who are having children for the first time, this is a new and different environment they need to adapt to. It is expected that all parents have to deal with daily common parenting situations such as being nagged or whined at, responding and resolving siblings\' arguments, frequently tidying and cleaning up children\'s mess, and more of other, similar everyday events (Crnic and Greenberg [14]). Parenting a child can be a difficult task (Crnic and Booth [13]). More challenging children tend to be a source of significant daily stressors (Crnic and Greenberg [14]). With children growing and developing more abilities, they may also show behaviours that are considered by parents as stressful (Crnic and Booth [13]). These daily stressors are sometimes called hassles. Crnic and Greenberg ([14]) described them as \'irritating, frustrating, annoying, and distressing demands that to some degree characterize everyday transactions with the environment\' (Crnic and Greenberg [14], 1629). Being in such an environment and dealing with these everyday stressful situations can affect the psychological well-being of the parent. An individual, everyday event might have a small effect in itself; however, the cumulative impact of them over a day, several days, or longer periods can be perceived as stressors for parents and result in significant implications for the functioning of the parents and their families (Crnic and Greenberg [14]). A study by Crnic and Greenberg ([14]) reported that parenting stressors are associated with less satisfied parenting and less functional family status. Such stressors are not only putting the children at risk because of the stress, but, in fact, it also affects the whole family system (Patterson [43]). These everyday parenting stressors can be important determinants of parental well-being (Crnic and Booth [13]). They also might be a meaningful and more relevant context for conceptualising stress (DeLongis et al. [15]).\r\n\r\nIn summary, there is a huge body of work on the development of (strong) psychological responses to virtual stimuli, but no work investigates the apparent question of whether everyday situations and stressors presented in a non-immersive VR system can actually elicit stress responses to the users of the VR systems. We are addressing this gap by identifying suitable stressors for a common environment and scenario and by implementing and evaluating these stressors in a desktop-monitor virtual environment context.\r\n3. Identifying a sample of common everyday stressors for parents\r\n\r\nThis part of the research sought to practically identify and evaluate the most common everyday stressors in a scenario around a domestic family environment. To be more specific, the focus was on stressors with the following characteristics: everyday stressors that typically occur for parents in a house environment after having a newborn child.\r\n\r\nThree coherent, subsequent phases were designed and employed.\r\n\r\nA comprehensive review of related literature was conducted to collect and examine common stressors or stressful events/situations that may affect the psychological well-being of a person. The gathered stressors from this review fall into the following categories: ( 1) major stressors (e.g. death of spouse, divorce, or fired at work (Holmes and Rahe [27])); ( 2) minor everyday stressors (e.g. too many things to do, home maintenance, or preparing meals (Chamberlain and Zika [11])); and ( 3) special everyday family and parenting stressors including those after having a new child (e.g. continually cleaning up messes of toys or food, the need to keep a constant eye on where the kids are and what they are doing, and the kids\' demand to be entertained or to be played with (Crnic and Greenberg [14])).\r\n\r\nAfter removing the duplicated stressors, a comprehensive list of 152 stressors was generated from several references.\r\n\r\nRelying on one source (e.g. literature review) to gather requirements can result in insufficient data. A deeper knowledge and understanding can be achieved by conducting qualitative research (Cooper, Reimann, and Cronin [12]). Semi-structured interviews were conducted as a second source to identify and explain the most common everyday stressors for parents that typically happen in a home environment after having a newborn child. Six semi-structured interviews were conducted with six domain experts (mental health specialists). All were psychotherapists who are specialised in family, parenting, children, stress, and anxiety problems. The gathered data were analysed and results were added to the findings from the first phase.\r\n\r\nIt was not feasible nor desirable to implement and simulate all the stressors that were identified in the first two phases in the VR system. Therefore, another evaluation phase was necessary to better define and narrow down the results. A web-based survey was designed to assess the identified stressors based on their level of influence during the postnatal period on parents. The same six psychotherapists were invited again to participate in the survey. Their task was to indicate (based on their experience) the extent to which a parent who recently had a newborn child would be stressed in a home environment by the events in the list provided from the previous results. Seven-point Likert-like items were used, anchored with \'Not at all stressed\' to \'Extremely stressed\'.\r\n\r\nThe web-based survey resulted in a list of the stressors rated from the most to the least stressful based on the knowledge and experience of the domain experts. Given the scope of this research, and the focus on the everyday stressors, a final evaluation was performed, which excluded ( 1) all major stressors and ( 2) stressors that were clearly not relevant to the chosen environment in this research (a house environment).\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the stressors in the list, the new focus was on the most effective stimuli. The following top 13 most effective everyday stimuli as rated by the domain experts formed the basis for the implemented virtual stressors in the VR system:\r\n\r\n    Baby crying.\r\n\r\n    New family member.\r\n\r\n    Continually cleaning up messes of toys or food.\r\n\r\n    The need to keep a constant eye on where the kids are and what they are doing.\r\n\r\n    Too many things to do.\r\n\r\n    Too many things to do at once.\r\n\r\n    Too many responsibilities.\r\n\r\n    Overloaded with family responsibilities.\r\n\r\n    Too many interruptions.\r\n\r\n    Experiencing high levels of noise.\r\n\r\n    Troublesome neighbours.\r\n\r\n    Unsatisfactory housing conditions.\r\n\r\n    Housework.\r\n\r\nA suitable main task in the virtual environment was also developed from these findings.\r\n\r\nThe following section explains the system development including the implementation of the virtual stressors driven by the findings above. For the rest of the paper, the word \'stressors\' will always refer to the \'common, mild, everyday stimuli that typically occur for parents in a house environment after having a newborn child\'. The 13 identified stressors are the sample used in this research.\r\n\r\nWhile the above list is specific to the postnatal period in a domestic family house, they also include representative classes of stressors found in other environments. Interruptions, noise, workload-related stimuli, and so on, happen in almost all domestic, commercial, industrial, or clinical situations.\r\n4. System design and implementation\r\n\r\nUsing Google SketchUp™ software, a 3D house was modelled to be the virtual environment (Alghamdi et al. [ 1]). It is an approximately 737 square metre family house consisting of a main living room, kitchen, one bathroom, two bedrooms, and front- and backyards. A collection of 3D off-the-shelf furniture was used for the house, all from Google 3D Warehouse™. The main furniture included models such as chairs, couches, beds, curtains, and kitchen and bathroom items (Figure 1).\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 1. Virtual house test environment.\r\n\r\nThe system was designed as a collaborative virtual environment (CVE), where two networked users (i.e. a participant and an experimenter) interact in one virtual environment (similar to the concept of multiplayer virtual games). This design allowed for remote communication and collaboration between the two users. The game engine Unity 3D™ was used to build the system. The CVE provided two interfaces/applications that used the same virtual world and were synchronised with each other (i.e. one view for the participant and one view for the experimenter). Each interface enabled specific functionalities required for its user\'s tasks. More details of the system schematic architecture are illustrated in the following diagram (Figure 2).\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 2. Schematic of the system architecture (including data streams).\r\n\r\nTo build the networking component of the system, Unity Networking was used. The two Unity applications were connected via a Master Server. First, the participant\'s application starts and is registered with the Master Server. The experimenter then joins the already running connection.\r\n\r\nThe participant was represented in the virtual world using an avatar entity, which enabled her/him to move, navigate, interact, and respond within the environment. The interaction in the environment was designed and implemented in a direct way: to perform any interaction, the participant used a standard gaming joystick to pick up objects, hold them up, move with them, and then put them down by pressing the joystick button. No complex animated avatar was used for the participant. Figure 3 shows an example of a participant (first-person view) picking up a toy, holding it (appears in front the participant), moving with it, and finally placing it in a toy box.\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 3. Example of an interaction in the environment.\r\n\r\nTo enable collision, a sphere/capsule collider was added to the avatar, which made it naturally collide with objects when moving in the scene rather than going through them (e.g. with walls and furniture).\r\n\r\nThe connection over the network detects the inputs of the participant and applies them to the avatar, and then sends them across the network to the experimenter application for synchronisation. The participant included the avatar\'s head movement and rotation and the object interaction. The experimenter interface provided more control over the system. When the application starts, the experimenter has a first-person view from the participant\'s perspective. This means the experimenter sees exactly what the participant sees (WYSIWIS). At the bottom of the interface, a control area is located for managing the virtual stressors (starting and stopping them) and changing the views inside the house. The experimenter actions applied to the stressors were synchronised to the participant application (this is the primary exposure process). The multiple views functionality of the experimenter allowed him/her to switch to a non-first-person view of the participant, then the simple avatar representation can be seen moving in the virtual world (additional observation functionality).\r\n\r\nThe system supported video communication to enable the two users to communicate in a shared environment. This function was implemented in the system using a videoconferencing communication library called Video Chat developed by Midnight Status (Status [63]). Using this library, the video and audio streams were processed and queued, then sent over the network in point-to-point streams between the two networked applications. A webcam image was compressed to 4 K pixels; this was done at 30 frames per second. Because the video communication screens in the system were small, the resolution was kept low, so there was no need for a high-resolution image. This also resulted in low required bandwidth. The screen size of the videoconferencing window for both users was the same, 85 mm × 55 mm on monitor. The total bandwidth was about 270 kB per second for the communication (video and audio).\r\n\r\nFigure 4 shows screenshots of the graphical user interface for both the participant and the experimenter.\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 4. User interfaces: experimenter (left) and participant (right).\r\n\r\nBased on the identified stressors listed earlier, a set of VR representations was developed in the virtual environment (Table A1, Appendix). All these virtual stressors focus on those that might typically arise for parents in a house environment after having a new child (examples in Figure 5).\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 5. Examples of the VR stressors (clockwise from top left): a messy room to be cleaned up, a baby crying in the cradle, a toddler near medication, and a toddler near a knife.\r\n5. Method of the experiment\r\n\r\nThis experiment investigated the influence of the developed VR stimuli on participants\' levels of stress and anxiety. The resulting stress and anxiety were measured using three standardised psychological tests and two physiological measures (see method section 5.4). Stress and anxiety in this context are overlapping concepts, and henceforth will be referred to only as stress for simplicity. Exposure to the VR stressors lasted for seven minutes and could be present or absent depending on the session. During the experiment, the participants were asked about their stress, sense of presence, workload, and task completion.\r\n\r\nTwo main questions were examined:\r\n\r\n    To what extent do the VR stimuli have an influence on levels of stress of the participant?\r\n\r\n    Which relationships exist between levels of stress and sense of presence, workload, and task completion performance in the virtual environment?\r\n\r\n5.1. Experimental design and ethics\r\n\r\nThe experiment followed a within-subjects design with three levels (baseline versus non-exposure versus stress exposure). Additionally, all participants performed two task conditions in the virtual environment. The main task was identical in both conditions; however, the Non-exposure Condition had no exposure to the stressors, whereas in the Exposure Condition, an exposure to the stressors was applied. To avoid any possible learning effect, the conditions were fully counterbalanced in a randomised order. The VR stressors in the Exposure Condition were also applied in a counterbalanced randomised order. This was to control the relationship between the stressors\' orders and their influence.\r\n\r\nUsing techniques designed to stress participants was the central ethical consideration. This experiment was approved by the University of Otago Ethics Committee (Reference: 15/021). The safety of the participants was taken seriously during the experiment to protect them from any possible physical and mental harm. The participants were provided with information sheets prior to the experiment, and a written consent form was signed and obtained from each participant.\r\n5.2. Participants\r\n\r\nA total of 54 adult participants (34 females and 20 males) took part in the experiment. The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 62 years (M = 28.67, SD = 9.85). The dominant ethnicity was New Zealand European by 31 participants, and the marital status varied (i.e. single: 21; married: 17; partnership: 12; divorced: 2; and other: 2). Overall, 34 participants did not have any children, while 20 participants reported having children (two female participants indicated that they have recently given birth, within the past six months).\r\n\r\nParticipants were recruited from the University of Otago by advertising around the university. The majority of them were university students; staff were also included. None of the participants had any prior knowledge of the experiment. All participants were given a $20 gift voucher after completing the experiment as an appreciation for their participation.\r\n5.3. Apparatus\r\n\r\nThe participant and the experimenter were located in the same room during the experiment. Two desks containing the hardware set-ups were appropriately arranged in one physical room, separated from each other through several cubical partition walls. This was to make the participant and the experimenter see and hear each other only via the system (Figure 6).\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 6. Hardware set-ups (experimenter left and participant right).\r\n\r\nAlmost identical hardware set-ups were used by the participant and the experimenter (Windows 7, Dell OptiPlex 3020 PC (Intel Core TM i5-4670 @3.40 GHZ, RAM 8 GB), LCD screen (Dell E1910C, 19″, 1440 × 900), Logitech HD webcam C270, Tritton Kunai stereo headset). The experimenter operated the system with a standard computer mouse, while the participant used a standard gaming joystick (Logitech X3D).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the present experiment investigated the physiological reactions of the participants (HR and galvanic skin response (GSR)). To gather and record the participants\' physiological data during the experiment, data acquisition devices/systems were used (ADInstruments). These instruments were a PowerLab system, Pulse Transducer, GSR Amp, and GSR Finger Electrode (Figure 7). The software LabChart was used to capture, visualise, and store the collected data from the instruments. The experimenter used an additional laptop dedicated only for capturing and managing the physiological data (MacBook Pro, 15-inch, 2.7 GHz Intel Core i7, 16 GB DDR3).\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 7. The devices attached to a participant during the experiment.\r\n5.4. Measures\r\n\r\nData were gathered using four approaches: self-report questionnaires, task completion performance data (in the virtual environment), physiological measures, and semi-structured interviews.\r\n5.4.1. Self-report questionnaires\r\n\r\nDemographic information: several characteristics were gathered about the participants, including gender, age, marital status, whether the participant has children or experience looking after children, and the participant\'s level of expertise in playing VR games.\r\n\r\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI): STAI\'s Form \'Y\' was used to measure perceived anxiety (Spielberger and Gorsuch [60]). This measure consists of 40 questions using a 4-point Likert-like scale measuring two types of anxiety: state anxiety (items 1–20) and trait anxiety (items 21–40). The higher the item score, the higher the anxiety level. State or situational anxiety items were more appropriate and fit for the present experiment design. Thus, they were employed to measure the change in the anxiety level.\r\n\r\nSubjective Units of Discomfort Scale (SUDS): a scale for measuring the subjective intensity of discomfort or anxiety experienced by an individual. A Likert-like scale was used, ranging from \'0 totally relaxed\' to \'10 highest anxiety/discomfort that you have ever felt\' (Wolpe [67]).\r\n\r\nSubjective stress: a one-item question for subjective stress was used to directly ask how stressed participants were feeling (perceived stress). This one-question item used a Likert-like scale from \'0 – not at all stressed\' to \'10 – extremely stressed\'.\r\n\r\nWorkload (NASA-Task Load IndeX (TLX)): perceived workload in the VR environment was measured using the NASA-Task Load Index. This is a subjective multidimensional tool that was used to assess the task performance effectiveness. It measures six aspects related to task demands (i.e. mental demand, physical demand, and temporal demand) and the individual\'s reactions (i.e. performance, effort, and frustration) (Hart [23]). The original six items were used with modified Likert-like scales ranging from \'0 very low\' to \'10 very high\'. This minor modification to the scale was done due to the consistency with the other measures in the questionnaire.\r\n\r\nIgroup Presence Questionnaire (IPQ): sense of presence in the VR environment was assessed using the IPQ designed by Schubert, Friedmann, and Regenbrecht ([52]). It consists of 14 items on 7-point Likert-like scales ranging from −3 to 3. The IPQ construct measures three important components related to presence: involvement (level of awareness of the VR environment), spatial presence (the connection between the VR environment and the real physical environment), and realism (the feeling of how real the VR environment is).\r\n\r\nAdditional measures for the VR stressors: to provide more assessment and in-depth evaluation about the VR stressors, additional measures were used to examine each stressor individually and in combination with the others. The participants were asked to rate each stressor based on levels of ( 1) awareness, ( 2) stress, ( 3) involvement, and ( 4) realism. At the end, the same questions were asked to examine these four factors when dealing with multiple or a combination of stressors. For scoring, Likert-like scales were used ranging from 0 (not at all) to 10 (very).\r\n5.4.2. Task completion performance\r\n\r\nThis measured how successful the participant was in completing the main task in the VR environment in the given time (Section 5.5), which was measured by the number of objects collected successfully. Higher levels of completion mean higher task completion performance.\r\n5.4.3. Physiological data\r\n\r\nChanges in physiological data were measured as an additional examination for the elicited stress responses to the VR stressors.\r\n\r\nThe HR and GSR were the two types of physiological data that were gathered.\r\n\r\nHR was monitored continuously using a pulse transducer. The transducer was applied around the participant\'s middle finger of the non-dominant hand and then connected directly to the PowerLab main unit.\r\n\r\nGSR or skin conductivity is a change in the electrical properties of the skin. The GSR finger electrode was applied to the index and ring fingers of the participant\'s non-dominant hand and then connected to the GSR amplifier of the PowerLab unit.\r\n5.4.4. Semi-structured interviews\r\n\r\nThe self-reporting questionnaire and physiological data often do not answer the Why questions. To explain and understand participants\' perceptions and reactions, a semi-structured interview was conducted with each participant at the end of the experiment. Open-ended questions were asked covering the aspects of the VR environment, VR stressors, task, stress, and sense of presence.\r\n5.5. Scenarios, tasks, and VR exposure\r\n\r\n5.5.1. Non-exposure condition\r\n\r\nIn a CVE displayed on screen, participants experienced and performed simulated everyday family activities designed to be similar to those in real life. In this scenario, the participant performed the role of a parent tidying up her/his messy house. This main task \'tidying up\' was suitable in giving the experiment scenario. It was identified based on the results from the stressors identification process. Using the joystick, this task involved the act of moving around the messy house, picking up the task items, and then placing them in the appropriate places (taking the rubbish to the waste bin, the books to the bookshelf, the children toys to the toy box, the dirty clothes to the washing basket, etc.). The participant was encouraged to tidy up the house in seven minutes. The (remote) experimenter observed the participant\'s activity in the VR environment. When necessary, the experimenter could provide some help when asked by the participant. The video communication function facilitated the remote communication between the two parties.\r\n5.5.2. Exposure condition\r\n\r\nIn this condition, the participant and the experimenter carried out the same scenarios and tasks from the non-exposure condition. The participant\'s main task was still tidying up the virtual house in the same approach and time frame. In addition, while the participant was doing the main task, the experimenter controlled (trigger and stop) the everyday family stressors in the virtual house. The participant interacted and responded to these stressors while carrying out the tidying activity. The word \'stressors\' was not used in the instructions provided to the participants at all (i.e. instruction sheet). Instead, the word \'situations\' was used as an indirect reference for the VR stressors. This was to avoid any possible pre-influence on how the participants would feel about them. The participants had no knowledge of what the situations were that they needed to deal with. All they knew was that as parents they had to tidy up their messy house and take care of any other situations that may happen in their house. The participants knew that they were parents of two children in the house, a newborn child and a two-year-old toddler (this information was provided in the instruction sheet). Also, they were informed that as parents they needed to keep a frequent eye on where their children were and what they were doing.\r\n\r\nThe task completion performance in the VR environment was measured based on how many tidying items were collected successfully in the seven minutes of the condition. The higher the number, the higher the task completion performance level.\r\n\r\nTo perform the exposure, the experimenter triggered each individual stressor separately; then, at the end of the condition, a combination of all stressors was triggered together. The rationale behind this was to be able to evaluate the effect of each stressor alone, then, the combination of the stressors, which is likely to have a greater impact. The exposure started after fifteen seconds from the beginning of the condition. Overall, each stressor was triggered for 30 seconds and a gap of non-exposure of 10 seconds was placed between the stressors. The timing for the toddler stressor was different due to the three situations. Each situation was triggered for 10 seconds, planned appropriately when the participant was going towards the area where the situation was.\r\n5.6. Procedure\r\n\r\nData were only collected from participants and not from the experimenter. The experiment took approximately 45 minutes.\r\n\r\nBefore the experiment began, all participants were provided with information sheets and consent forms, which provided detailed explanations. If they agreed and signed the consent forms, they proceeded to the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe data collection for the self-report questionnaires was divided into three parts: before the first condition (baseline), after the first condition, and after the second condition. Physiological data were collected continuously only during the two conditions (HR and GSR). No baseline of the physiological data was measured. These self-report questionnaires and physiological data were needed to determine the influence of the changes in the virtual environment, mainly that of the VR stressors on the participants\' feelings and perceptions while carrying out the tasks.\r\n\r\nBefore the first condition, the first set of questionnaires was given to the participant to complete (demographic, STAI, Subjective Stress, and SUDS). Then, the participant went through a short demonstration and practised how to operate the system (software and hardware). Once the participant became familiar with the equipment, an instruction sheet was provided that described the scenario and task step by step.\r\n\r\nTo ensure equal treatment for all participants, the experimenter followed a predesigned instruction sheet during the experiment. It explained the tasks for the experimenter in detail.\r\n\r\nWhen the participant was ready for the first condition, the devices for collecting the physiological data were attached to the participant\'s hand (the pulse transducer for HR and the GSR finger electrode). The participants were informed to avoid any movement of the hand (including fingers) to avoid having noise in the data. They were given the time to choose a comfortable location for the hand before the start.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing all essential preparation, the first condition started. During this condition, the participant and the experimenter performed their tasks as explained earlier. The physiological data were collected during the entire first condition of seven minutes. When the condition was completed, a second set of questionnaires was completed, which took approximately five minutes (STAI, Subjective Stress, SUDS, NASA-TLX, and IPQ).\r\n\r\nNext, the second condition of another seven minutes started, which also contained a measurement of the physiological data. This condition included the exposure process that was explained earlier (the condition order was randomly balanced). When the second condition was completed, the collection of the physiological data ended and the devices were disconnected. Then, a third and last set of questions was completed by the participants (STAI, Subjective Stress, SUDS, NASA-TLX, IPQ, and the additional measures for the VR stressors).\r\n\r\nThe final stage of the data collection process was the semi-structured interviews. They were conducted at the end of the experiment, which focused on open-ended questions. Each interview took approximately 10 minutes. After finishing the interviews, the participants were thanked and given gift vouchers.\r\n6. Results\r\n\r\nIn this section, we report on the results from the self-report questionnaires, task completion performance, physiological measures, and semi-structured interviews.\r\n6.1. Self-report questionnaires\r\n\r\nDistribution tests were performed for the measurement variables. Histogram outputs and a Shapiro–Wilk test showed that all the tested variables were normally distributed except for the task completion performance. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to test subjective stress, STAI, and SUDS.\r\n6.1.1. Subjective stress\r\n\r\nFor subjective stress, Mauchly\'s test indicated that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, χ2( 2) = 32.18, p < .001; therefore, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε = .68). The results show that there was a significant change in subjective stress perceived by participants across the three times during the experiment, F(1.36, 72.52) = 81.60, p < .001, ω2 = 0.60. Post hoc pairwise comparison with adjustment for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni method was used and showed that subjective stress was significantly higher in the exposure condition than the other two conditions (non-exposure and baseline). The participants were significantly more stressed in the exposure condition (M = 6.28, SD = 1.91) compared to the non-exposure condition and baseline, respectively (M = 3.31, SD = 1.57, means difference = 2.96, p < .001); (M = 3.02, SD = 1.59, means difference = 3.25, p < .001). The results suggested no significant difference in the scores between the non-exposure condition and baseline (means difference = 0.296, p = .209). Figure 8 shows the difference in means of subjective stress during the experiment.\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 8. Means for the reported subjective stress.\r\n6.1.2. State-trait anxiety – STAI\r\n\r\nWhen examining the STAI variable, Mauchly\'s test showed that the assumption of sphericity had been violated, χ2( 2) = 86.75, p < .001. Correction for degrees of freedom was employed using Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε = .55). Like subjective stress, the results indicated that there was a significant difference in STAI scoring during the experiment, F(1.10, 58.51) = 496.62, p < .001, ω2 = 0.90 (Figure 9). Further analysis using post hoc pairwise comparison (with adjustment for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni method) reported that the STAI level was significantly higher in the exposure condition compared to the non-exposure and baseline conditions. Results showed that the participants were significantly more anxious when exposed to the VR stressors (M = 56.31, SD = 8.42) than during the non-exposure condition and baseline, respectively (M = 30.28, SD = 5.91, means difference = 26.03, p < .001; M = 29.69, SD = 6.06, means difference = 26.63, p < .001). No significant difference was found between the non-exposure condition and baseline (means difference = 0.59, p = .187).\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 9. Means for the reported STAI.\r\n6.1.3. Subjective of discomfort – SUDS\r\n\r\nThe results of SUDS showed that the sphericity\'s assumption had been violated, χ2( 2) = 43.92, p < .001. Again, degrees of freedom were corrected using Greenhouse–Geisser estimates of sphericity (ε = .63). Similarly to previous results, the results suggested that there was a significant change in SUDS scores, F(1.27, 67.50) = 205.79, p < .001, ω2 = 0.79 (Figure 10). Based on the post hoc pairwise comparison (with adjustment for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni method), SUDS scores were significantly higher in the exposure condition compared to the others. The SUDS level significantly increased during the exposure of the VR stressors (M = 6.91, SD = 1.62) compared to the condition with no stressors and baseline, respectively (M = 3.11, SD = 1.61, means difference = 3.79, p < .001; M = 2.91, SD = 1.58, means difference = 4.00, p < .001). Analysis revealed that there was no significant difference between the condition with no stressors and baseline (means difference = 0.20, p = 0.210).\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 10. Means for the reported SUDS.\r\n6.1.4. Workload (NASA-TLX) and sense of presence (IPQ)\r\n\r\nSince the variables workload (NASA-TLX) and sense of presence (IPQ) consist of two conditions (non-exposure condition and exposure condition), two-tailed paired samples t tests were used (Figure 11). Results revealed that there was a significant difference in the scores for NASA-TLX in the exposure condition (M = 6.10, SD = 1.26) and the one with no exposure (M = 4.41, SD = 1.53); (t(53) = 9.25, p < .001). There was also a significant difference in IPQ, showing that the exposure condition (M = 1.42, SD = 0.44) received significantly higher scores compared to the non-exposure condition (M = 0.02, SD = 1.02); (t(53) = 11.51, p < .001).\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 11. Means for workload as measured by the NASA-TLX (figure left) and the reported sense of presence IPQ (figure right).\r\n\r\nA Pearson correlation analysis revealed a moderate positive correlation between NASA-TLX and IPQ, r = 0.43, n = 54, p = .001 (Figure 12). Participants who reported higher workload indicated higher level of sense of presence. NASA-TLX also showed a moderate positive correlation with STAI, r = 0.32, n = 54, p = .01. No other significant correlations were found between NASA-TLX/IPQ and the other variables.\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 12. Scatter plot of correlation between workload (NASA-TLX) and sense of presence (IPQ).\r\n6.1.5. Additional measure for the VR stressors\r\n\r\nThe results showed that all participants were very aware of all the VR stressors in the environment, reporting an overall M of 8.38 out of 10. As expected when testing how stressful each stressor was, the results showed that the combination of all stressors together had the strongest impact (M = 8.22), followed by the crying baby (M = 7.43) and the toddler stressor (M = 6.65). The lowest was the pet noise (M = 3.69).\r\n\r\nThe involvement level was different between the active and the passive stressors. On the one hand, the participants devoted a reasonably high level of involvement with the active stressors (crying baby M = 8.76, untidy/messy house M = 8.44, doorbell M = 7.52, telephone M = 7.43, cell phone M = 7.02, toddler M = 7, and the combination M = 6.96), whereas the passive stressors received a low level of involvement (neighbour\'s noise M = 1.24, street noise M = 1.56, and pet noise M = 2.20).\r\n\r\nThe level of realism of all the VR stressors was reasonable and above midpoint (M = 6.11). The highest level was for the toddler (M = 7.11), followed by the combination of stressors (M = 7.02), and then the crying baby (M = 6.86).\r\n6.2. Task completion performance\r\n\r\nThe task completion performance measured how successful the participant was in completing the main task (tidying up the house). This implies how many task items were collected successfully. Results showed that participants had lower task completion performance in the exposure condition (M = 30.50, SD = 10.30) than in the non-exposure one (M = 56.67, SD = 15.19), with mean difference of 26.16.\r\n6.3. Confounding variables\r\n\r\nThe results may be influenced by some characteristics of the participant. Two relevant confounding variables were examined during the data analysis: gender and whether the participant has children.\r\n\r\nThe analysis showed no significant effect of gender on any of the examined variables across all conditions. Having children, on the other hand, had a significant effect on some of the variables. The three variables used to measure levels of stress (subjective stress, STAI, and SUDS) had been influenced by whether or not the participant was a parent. This significant impact only occurred during the exposure condition. Two-tailed independent samples t tests showed that non-parent participants reported significantly higher scores for subjective stress, STAI, and SUDS, during the exposure condition compared to parent participants (Table 1 shows the results).\r\n\r\nTable 1. t test results for the influence of parenting.\r\n\r\nVariable	Groups	M	SD	t(52)	P\r\nSubjective stress	Non-parents	7.06	1.57	4.58	<.001\r\nParents	4.95	1.73\r\nSTAI	Non-parents	59.41	7.72	3.98	<.001\r\nParents	51.05	6.91\r\nSUDS	Non-parents	7.50	1.33	3.93	<.001\r\nParents	5.90	1.61\r\n\r\nNo significant effect was detected of parenting on the baseline or the non-exposure condition of these three variables. For NASA-TLX and IPQ, having children did not show any significant effect on scores in both conditions too.\r\n6.4. Physiological data results\r\n\r\nFirst, the gathered data were checked for noise that resulted from hand movement. Twenty-one participants were excluded due to noise in the data. The analyses of the physiological data were based on the data from the remaining 33 participants (21 females, 12 males). The age of the participants ranged from 18 to 50 years (M = 29.18, SD = 9.59).\r\n\r\nNormality tests were then conducted on the variables for the two conditions. Results from the Shapiro–Wilk test suggest that both GSR and HR data were normally distributed.\r\n\r\nOutcomes showed that there were statistically significant differences of GSR and HR scores when comparing between the exposure condition and the non-exposure condition (Figure 13). A two-tailed paired samples t test indicated that the GSR level was significantly higher in the exposure condition (M = 8.65, SD = 4.29) than in the non-exposure condition (M = 5.40, SD = 2.81); t(32) = 6.97, p < .001. An average mean difference of 3.25 μSiemens was recorded between the two conditions. Furthermore, a two-tailed paired samples t test showed that HR in the exposure condition (M = 79.39, SD = 12.78) increased compared to that in the non-exposure condition (M = 74.75, SD = 11.60). The increase was statistically significant t(32) = 6.71, p < .001. A 4.64 beats per minute was the average mean difference between the two conditions. No significant differences were found in the variances between the exposure and non-exposure conditions in both GSR and HR.\r\n\r\nGraph: Figure 13. Means of physiological measures GSR (figure left) and HR (figure right).\r\n6.5. Semi-structured interview results\r\n\r\nFour participants declined the interview, leaving 50 participants in the analysis. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were analysed using a GIA (Elo and Kyngäs [19]). This approach was conducted following the recommendations of Thomas ([62]). The purpose was to identify emerging themes in the data. Text segments or sentences with similar meaning were gathered in several groups to create thematic categories. All categories were then organised into a hierarchal relationship based on the similarity in the meaning and topic, which allowed three major themes to emerge. Two coders assessed the coding consistency (inter-rater reliability) and member check (credibility). The inter-rater reliability was 93% (raw agreement), and disagreements were discussed and resolved. Additionally, the member check resulted in points of view and minor modifications were discussed until agreement was reached and the interpretations of the findings were confirmed. As a result, 30 sub-categories were identified. The following sections show the main themes with summaries of sub-categories with quotes (the sub-categories were summarised given the length condition of this paper, without affecting the quality of the results).\r\n6.5.1. Theme 1: perceived stress in the virtual environment\r\n\r\nParticipants provided statements that indicated their feeling of stress during the experiment. The findings showed a difference between the two conditions in terms of evoking stress. Three sub-themes emerged from this first theme:\r\n\r\n    The majority of the participants (96%, n = 48) indicated that they were more stressed/anxious in the exposure condition compared to the non-exposure one:\r\n\r\n    the second session [the exposure condition] definitely was more stressful. (P1)\r\n\r\n    Having determined that the exposure condition was perceived as more stressful, the participants were asked why they felt more stressed or anxious during this condition. They highlighted the following reasons as factors that created this level of stress in the virtual environment: too many things/tasks to do (28%, n = 14), too many things/tasks to do at once (28%, n = 14), looking after the children (42%, n = 21), mental demand (16%, n = 8), high levels of noise (10%, n = 5), unexpected events (10%, n = 5), and too many interruptions and distractions (6%, n = 3):\r\n\r\n    \' ... because there are lots of things with high priority that got in the way of the original task\' (P21) ... . \' ... because lots of things happened at once and you don\'t have time to do them all\' (P5)) ... . \' ... when I saw the kid trying to eat the medicine I said oh my god my child is going to eat that medicine, I stressed even though it wasn\'t real\' (P10) ... . \' ... because there was too many demand and they are potentially urgent like the dangerous knife with the child and the baby crying, the sort of things you have to attend to and cannot wait\' (P46) ... . \' ... cannot deal with screaming babies\' (P28) ... .\' ... because all the unexpected situations\' (P3) ... . \' ... because you want to achieve the task and you have distractions especially toward the end\' (P13)\r\n\r\n    Differences and commonalities in parents and non-parents: some parents (25%, n = 13) were more familiar and close to the scenario. This was a result of the parenting scenario/tasks during the exposure condition, which are related to their real life:\r\n\r\n     ... for me I felt I was familiar with all the situations in the second session [the exposure condition] because they happen often in my life as a mother. (P37, a mother)\r\n\r\nMost of both parents and non-parents (90%, n = 45) paid more consideration towards the children compared to other stressors during the exposure:\r\n\r\n ... I was much more concerned about the toddler/baby than in accomplishing the tasks, they were my main focus ... I think in the back of my mind I was always worried where is the toddler was and what is getting into. (P37, a mother)\r\n\r\nSome of the parents and some non-parents showed a common technique when dealing with the stressors (20%, n = 10). The technique reported was prioritising based on the importance of the task. From the findings, the children task was regarded as the most important task in almost all cases (92%, n = 46). This technique was described as a common approach that participants usually follow when facing a similar scenario in real life:\r\n\r\n ... you had to try to juggle many different things and I tried to prioritise with that as well ... I had to decide which one was more important like the baby and the toddler. (P11, non-parent)\r\n6.5.2. Theme 2: perceived sense of presence\r\n\r\nWhen the participants were asked about their feelings of presence in the virtual environment, they reported different perceptions during the experiment. Findings about sense of presence were revealed in three main sub-themes: realism, spatial presence, and involvement:\r\n\r\n    Most of the participants (84%, n = 42) reported that the virtual environment was more real in the exposure condition compared to the non-exposure one. Only few participants (12%, n = 6) felt that the non-exposure condition was more realistic due to the scenario in the environment, which was not similar to their real life:\r\n\r\n    I think the second session [the exposure one] was more realistic to me. (P1)\r\n\r\n    The feeling of being physically present in the virtual environment varied during the experiment. The majority of the participants (86%, n = 43) stated that they felt greater spatial presence in the virtual environment during the exposure condition compared to the non-exposure one:\r\n\r\n    for me the one with the kids [the exposure condition] I felt more present. (P37)\r\n\r\n    The participants described more involvement as another characteristic of the exposure condition. They found the environment more involving and engaging because of the higher level of interaction resulting from the stressors:\r\n\r\n     ... also the interaction with everything happened, it was more interactive, you get more heavily involve. (P15)\r\n\r\n6.5.3. Theme 3: similarity and sensibility between the virtual environment and real life\r\n\r\nThere was a clear connection between real-life experiences/scenarios and how participants perceived the virtual environment. Some participants (40%, n = 20) reported that they related more to the virtual environment during the exposure condition as it reflected a similar and sensible representation of the real life:\r\n\r\n ... this like in my real life, like when I have to tidy up I usually have to respond to extra stuff happening. (P15)\r\n7. Discussion\r\n\r\nThe findings from this research obtained from healthy participants confirmed that virtual representations of typical everyday domestic stressors in a non-immersive VR environment can induce significant psychological and physiological reactions to stress. The examined stressors in this research were a type of mild stimuli that typically arise for parents in a house environment after having a newborn child. Unlike major stressors or significant life changes, these stressors tend to occur very often (Crnic and Greenberg [14]). In real life, such an individual event may not have strong effects on stress; however, it is the cumulative impact of a number of them over a period that makes them stressors (Crnic and Greenberg [14]). In the current VR environment/scenario, participants felt significantly more stressed and anxious when confronted by these common stressors in the exposure condition compared to the non-exposure one. This was clearly indicated by the self-report measures (STAI, SUDS, and subjective stress). Similarly, changes were detected in participants\' physiological responses during the experiment. Levels of HR and GSR showed a statistically significant increase in the exposure condition compared to the non-exposure one. This is supported by Meehan et al. ([37]) reporting that HR and GSR tend to increase when exposed to stressful VR environments/situations. Furthermore, during the semi-structured interviews, almost all participants (96%) confirmed this finding by clearly stating that they felt greater stress in the exposure condition resulting from the triggered stressors.\r\n\r\nStressors used in the experiment were analysed in order to better understand and explore their levels of influence on the participants. In the self-report questionnaire, participants subjectively indicated their perceptions of each stressor in terms of awareness, involvement, realism, and how stressful it was. The previous results section showed that all participants were very aware of all stressors in the environment, even if it was just presented on a desktop monitor screen, especially when the stimuli occurred together. The involvement level was high with all the active stressors (e.g. the crying baby, looking after the toddler, and the phones), as well as with the combination of the stressors and performing the main task (tidying up the house). However, there was low involvement with the passive stressors (e.g. neighbours\' loud argument, noisy street sirens, and noisy dogs barking). This result was expected, as the active stressors required responses, while the passive ones did not. Low involvement did not necessarily reflect on low induced stress as shown in the results. All the stressors contributed to the increase in stress. Looking after the two children appeared to evoke more stress than the others when dealing with the stressors individually. The findings in the interviews support this quantitative result. About 42% of the participants stated that they perceived the task of looking after the two children as stressful. This can be explained by the apparent attention and consideration that were given to the children in the virtual environment. It seemed that the virtual children avatars were very effective in targeting participants\' emotions similar to real-life situations, even if they were not highly photo-realistic. In particular, most of the parents linked this attachment to caring for their own children. During the exposure, a significant number of participants showed strong emotional attachment to the two children.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when responding to the multiple stressors at the same time, participants adopted a technique/solution from real-life experience, which also gave more focus to the children. The majority of parents and some non-parents followed a prioritising technique, dealing and responding to the most important and urgent event/stressor first. The children task was regarded as the most important task in almost all cases. This technique was described as a common approach that participants usually follow when facing a similar scenario in real life.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was the combination of stressors that had the strongest effect compared to any other individual stressor. This corresponds with real-life situations as it is shown that a combination of stressors would be likely to lead to greater impact compared to facing a single stressor (Bartenwerfer, [ 4], [ 5], [ 6]; Myrtek and Spital [40]). The factor \'Too many things/tasks to do at once\' is also known to be stressful in real life (Kohn, Lafreniere, and Gurevich [30]; Kohn and Macdonald [31]). Participants strongly supported and confirmed this quantitative result during the interviews. In most feedback, participants indicated that responding to multiple situations at once was a difficult and stressful/anxious task during the exposure condition.\r\n\r\nDuring the semi-structured interviews, more details were uncovered regarding the stressors. Participants stated in detail factors that made them feel more stressed and anxious in the environment, all of which were also reported to be everyday stressors in real-life situations. Also, these resulting factors did match some of those identified earlier during the three-stage process in the research, which focused on gathering and evaluating the implemented everyday stressors in the VR environment. The factors from the semi-structured interviews included the following:\r\n\r\n    Too many things/tasks to do (Kanner et al. [28]; Holahan, Holahan, and Belk [26]; Bolger et al. [ 7]; Chamberlain and Zika [11]).\r\n\r\n    Mental demand (Bolger et al. [ 7]).\r\n\r\n    High levels of noise (Kanner et al. [28]; Holahan, Holahan, and Belk [26]; Kohn and Macdonald [31]).\r\n\r\n    Unexpected events (Kanner et al. [28]).\r\n\r\n    Too many interruptions and distractions (Kanner et al. [28]; Chamberlain and Zika [11]; Crnic and Greenberg [14]).\r\n\r\nThe quantitative results revealed that gender of participants had no impact on their levels of stress during the whole experiment. Interestingly, the difference in whether or not the participant has children (parenting) was shown to have a significant effect on levels of stress. Only during the exposure condition did non-parents feel significantly more stressed and anxious compared to parents. This result suggests that to some extent non-parents and parents perceived the stressors in the VR environment differently. The findings from the interviews seem to provide some explanations for why this significant difference occurred. Focusing on the parenting scenario/tasks during the exposure condition, the majority of parents stated that they were very familiar with such an environment and scenario. As they are parents, they relate to similar circumstances in their real lives. In contrast, some non-parents indicated that they were not familiar with the parenting scenario and the tasks as they differ from what they interact and deal with in their real lives.\r\n\r\nAccording to Schuemie et al. ([53]), it is very important that the details in the VR environment match reality. It seems that participants\' emotions and feelings in VR may differ from one to another based on their real-life experience. In the current finding, the familiarity with the scenario as well as the prior experience of dealing with similar real-life situations may have given parents a degree of resilience capability towards such an environment. Consequently, they felt significantly less stressed and anxious than non-parents who lack the familiarity and the prior experience in such situations. Some researchers have argued that repeated stress exposure can desensitise people to stimuli that may possibly create negative psychological reactions (Wiederhold, Bullinger, and Wiederhold [65]).\r\n\r\nThe level of the sense of presence was found to be significantly higher during the stressful condition compared to the natural one (non-exposure). As discussed during the review of the related work, it has been shown that sense of presence and emotions are likely to associate with each other in virtual environments (Bouchard et al. [10]; Pallavicini et al. [42]), in particular for immersive environments. Higher levels of emotions, such as stress, anxiety, or fear, can lead to a higher level of sense of presence. This connection was investigated in different scenarios such as fear of heights (Regenbrecht, Schubert, and Friedmann [47]; Schuemie et al. [53]; Michaud et al. [38]) and fear of snakes (Bouchard et al. [10]). Other studies demonstrated that a low level of sense of presence can reduce emotional reactions such as anxiety in VR environments (Pallavicini et al. [42]). In the current research, even though presence was significantly higher in the stressful/anxious environment, surprisingly, no significant correlations were found between presence and stress (i.e. subjective stress, STAI, and SUDS). Only a moderate positive correlation occurred between presence and perceived workload (NASA-TLX, a tool that measures task demands, i.e. mental demand, physical demand, and temporal demand) and the individual\'s reactions (i.e. performance, effort, and frustration) (Hart [23]). This means that participants who expressed the tasks as higher workload tended to feel a higher level of sense of presence in the environment, bearing in mind that perceived workload was significantly higher in the exposure condition as a result of the triggered stressors\r\n\r\nFrom the interview results, participants explained that the significant increase in levels of presence in the exposure condition resulted from the higher levels of realism, spatial presence, and involvement, which are the main components of the sense of presence (Schubert, Friedmann, and Regenbrecht [52]). In fact, the increase in these three factors resulted from the triggered stressors. Participants clarified that the stressors created several elements in the environment, which in return boosted these three components. They included sound/audio, more interactivity, focus and attention, and similarity and sensibility to reality.\r\n\r\nWhile we found that this non-immersive system elicited actual stress responses, it would be worthwhile to investigate whether a fully immersive system, for example, with a HMD), would lead to even higher responses. The bespoken literature would suggest such an assumption.\r\n8. Conclusions and future work\r\n\r\nIt is well established that especially immersive VR environments and stimuli related to significant life changes or scenarios can create emotional reactions such as stress, anxiety, or fear. However, no research has investigated whether non-immersive VR stimuli of common, mild stressors can produce similar outcomes. The main finding of the current research filled this gap by showing that desktop-monitor VR representations of common stimuli can in fact induce significant psychological reactions to stress. A mixed methodology approach was used in this research: quantitative (subjective self-reported measures), qualitative (semi-structured interviews), and physiological measures (HR and GSR). However, the quality of the physiological data is probably not valid enough to draw any serious conclusions mainly for three reasons: ( 1) there is too much noise in the data, mostly attributable to participants\' hand movements and ( 2) we only considered averaged measures per session, which is a too coarse granularity. Proper marked time-series analyses would be required here. ( 3) Apart from measuring GSR and HR in the non-exposure condition, there was no actual baseline measurement. This should be added in future studies.\r\n\r\nThe sense of presence increased significantly during the stressful and anxious environment compared to the natural one. Higher levels of realism, spatial presence, and involvement were the driving factors for the overall increase in presence, which resulted from the triggered stressors. Hence, the stimuli presented leveraged the sense of presence, thus making the environment more a VR, again with a non-immersive VR system.\r\n\r\nThis research also showed that people\'s emotions and behaviours in VR environments might be influenced by their real-life experience. For example, in the current stressful environment, having prior experience and familiarity with a parenting environment appeared to make parents significantly less stressed and anxious compared to non-parents who lack such experience. Moreover, many participants showed a clear emotional attachment towards the two virtual children in the environment. They connected this strong reaction to their real-life situations where they usually prioritise and put children first.\r\n\r\nBased on the overall findings of this research, results could possibly be generalised to other similar scenarios with different environments and/or to other types of everyday stressors using similar VR implementations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, future research should examine if the increase in stress is similar to the one produced by a real-life situations with similar characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe current VR implementation might offer future benefits in the area of stress desensitisation or enhancing people\'s resilience for such stressful environments in reality. We are currently working on this notion and continuing the research to expand its applications and psychological benefits.\r\n\r\nIn summary, we would like to emphasise that ( 1) mild stress stimuli can lead to actually perceived psychological responses, and ( 2) even non-immersive VR can be used to achieve this.\r\nAcknowledgements\r\n\r\nThe authors wish to thank all participants who volunteered to take part in the experiment.

The implemented VR stressors and the main task.\r\n\r\nThe driving stressors identified from the requirement analysis	The implemented VR stressors in the system	How it works in the VR environment\r\nActive stressors: Participants can respond to them when they occur\r\nA	Baby crying New family member The need to keep a constant eye on where the kids are and what they are doing Experiencing high levels of noise Too many interruptions Too many things to do Too many things to do at once Too many responsibilities	Looking after a newborn baby (loud crying baby)	A model of newborn baby can be triggered to cry loudly in the environment. The baby is located in a baby crib in the child\'s room. The crying sound is a 3D sound that can be affected by distance and rotation. The participant (parent in the VR environment) can respond and interact with the baby by holding it in an animated sequence\r\nB	The need to keep a constant eye on where the kids are and what they are doing Too many interruptions Too many things to do Too many things to do at once Too many responsibilities	Looking after a toddler (two-year-old toddler being in dangerous situations)	The toddler stressor can be triggered to be in three different dangerous situations: trying to reach a knife on the kitchen ground, climbing and standing on a baby-feeding high chair, and trying to reach an open medication bottle. Participants were exposed to all three situations at different stages during the session (beginning, middle, or end of the session). The participant can respond and interact with the three situations: taking the knife and placing it in a knife block on the kitchen table, taking the child down from the high chair, and taking and closing the medication bottle and then putting it on a high, safe shelf out of reach of the toddler. The toddler was fully rigged and animated with facial ex<x>pressions. The animation was a natural movement of the body parts in the same location. A 3D voice was also attached to the toddler to simulate a child talking. These features were implemented in an attempt to increase the sense of presence\r\nC	Too many interruptions Experiencing high levels of noise Too many things to do Too many things to do at once	Telephone (loud telephone ringing)	A very loud telephone ringing with a 3D tone located in the living room. The experimenter can trigger the phone and choose one of three possible recorded calls (i.e. family call, friend call, and telemarketer call). The same call was used with all participants in this experiment (family call). The phone calls were designed in a simple way as continuous talking. The scenarios of the calls developed to get the attention of the participant by expressing certain styles such as anger, excitement, or annoyance. The participant can respond to the phone ringing by answering the phone, which shows an animated sequence for the phone moving towards the participant\'s left ear, then the recorded call starts\r\nD	Too many interruptions Experiencing high levels of noise Too many things to do Too many things to do at once	Cell phone (loud cell phone ringing)	The tone of the cell phone is very loud and in 3D. The cell phone is located in the main bedroom and follows similar features/process of the telephone. Only the recorded calls are different (IT support call, insurance call, and bank customer\'s service call). The same insurance call was used with all participants in the experiment\r\nE	Too many interruptions Experiencing high levels of noise Too many things to do Too many things to do at once	Doorbell (loud doorbell)	A loud doorbell that can be triggered for any period needed. Participants respond by opening the door in which they find a post box left at the doorstep. They then take it and place it on the kitchen table\r\nF	Unsatisfactory housing conditions Housework Overloaded with family responsibilities Continually cleaning up messes of toys or food Too many things to do Too many things to do at once Too many responsibilities	Very messy house Main task: Tidying the messy house	This was considered as a stressor because very messy/untidy places can stress some people. Also, it was used as a main task in the VR environment. The action taken towards this situation was tidying up by picking up the task items and then placing them in the appropriate places\r\nPassive stressors: Do not require a response from participants\r\nG	Troublesome neighbours Too many interruptions Experiencing high levels of noise	Neighbours\' noise (loud argument and loud party)	A neighbour couple arguing and fighting with each other loudly. Also, gathering at a neighbour\'s house, partying loudly\r\nH	Experiencing high levels of noise	Street noise (loud siren)	A fire fighter\'s car with loud siren noise passing in front the house\r\nI	Experiencing high levels of noise. Too many interruptions	Pet noise (loud dogs barking and cats meowing)	A group of dogs barking and fighting each other loudly just behind the participant\'s house fence, and cats meowing loudly inside the house\r\nJ	All 13 identified stressors	A combination of all the implemented stressors	All stressors are triggered at once to create more demand and greater level of stress\r\n\r\nFootnotes\r\n\r\n1 Present address: HIT Lab NZ, University of Canterbury, Private Bag 4800, Christchurch 8140, New Zealand\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlghamdi, M., H.

Historically, VR has been cost-prohibitive for research trials and clinical interventions and impracticable/nongeneralizable because of limitations in software development and hardware availability. The new generation of VR head-mounted displays (HMDs) has become a common technology, available off the shelf, reasonably priced, and user-friendly for a wide age range. The demographic for VR has thus shifted from a narrow group of laboratory-based researchers or entertainment technologists to anyone with a smartphone or a game console. This opens the application of VR for wider use, including clinical application within a pediatric health-care setting. Given a heightened interest in preventive care and cost saving around health and wellness, and the concern about opioid addiction, VR may be perfectly suited for pain management.\r\n\r\nVR technology was historically recognized for its entertainment value or exclusively applied and tested in academic experimental research laboratories (Bailenson et al., 2008). However, as VR moves from the bench to the bedside, its application has expanded to a variety of clinical areas. In medical settings, earlier versions of VR have been evaluated as a means to attenuate pain perception, anxiety, and general distress during painful medical procedures, such as wound care, chemotherapy, dental procedures, and routine medical procedures (Furman et al., 2009; Gold, Kant, & Kim, 2005; Gold, Kim, Kant, Joseph, & Rizzo, 2006; Morris, Louw, & Grimmer-Somers, 2009; Schneider, Kisby, & Flint, 2011), thus paving the way for the study of the more innovative and cost-effective VR technologies now entering the market.\r\n\r\nVR is a state-of-the-art technologically advanced system that allows users to be fully immersed in a “virtual world” through a multimodal sensory experience (e.g., visual; auditory; tactile). This highly immersive and multisensory VR experience is therefore distinct from common forms of distraction (i.e., bubbles; books; toys) or passively watching television or movies, or playing a two-dimensional handheld video game or game console. Increasing access to VR technology and new software adaptations may prove to be a well-suited preventive intervention for painful medical interventions. VR draws heavily on the limited cognitive resource of attention, by drawing participants’ attention away from “real world” stimuli and into the “virtual world” (Hoffman, Patterson, Carrougher, & Sharar, 2001). Given the unique demand VR places on conscious attention, it is particularly well suited to reduce pain, and is one of the evidence-based strategies for pain management (see Mahrer & Gold, 2009; Malloy & Milling, 2010; Li, Montaño, Chen, & Gold, 2011 for reviews of the efficacy of VR for pain reduction). Previous research has supported the effectiveness of distraction during painful procedures, specifically needle pain (Birnie et al., 2014; Cohen, Cousins, & Martin, 2014; Goodenough et al., 1997; Maclaren & Cohen, 2005; Mason et al., 1999). VR, an arguably more powerful and immersive intervention, may be more effective than distraction at reducing pain and anxiety during painful medical procedures via a combination of attentional demands and other endogenous cortical systems.\r\n\r\nTo understand the underlying mechanistic origin for VR analgesia, investigators have considered the neurobiological interplay of brain cortices and neurochemistry, as well as emotional, cognitive, and attentional processes. While VR has been demonstrated in a variety of settings to effectively decrease pain and distress associated with painful procedures, researchers have only recently begun to identify neurobiological mechanisms underlying the effect of VR on the experience of pain, though previously accepted theories related to pain and attention likely apply. Gold and colleagues (Gold, Belmont, & Thomas, 2007) hypothesized that VR analgesia originates from intercortical modulation among signaling pathways of the pain matrix through attention, emotion, memory, and other senses (e.g., touch, auditory, and visual), thereby producing analgesia (Gold et al., 2007). They theorize that an overall decrease of activities in the pain matrix may be accompanied by increases of activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal regions of the brain. While there is no singular theory that contextualizes the mechanisms of action for VR, preliminary research supports the phenomenon of VR analgesia with decreased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) bold signals in the pain matrix, in conjunction with decreased subjective reports of pain and anxiety, in response to thermal pain (Hoffman et al., 2004). Gold and colleagues (Gold, Chen, Katz, & Nelson, 2010) have further demonstrated that VR reduces pain signaling in the pain matrix, while increasing fMRI bold signal in brain regions associated with executive function (i.e., precuneus) associated with descending pain modulatory circuitry, during the experience of thermal pain (Gold et al., 2010). This descending modulatory circuit is an “opioid-sensitive” circuit and relevant to experiences in many contexts, including in states of chronic pain, and in the actions of pain-relieving drugs, including opiates, cannabinoids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake blockers that mimic, in part, the actions of opiates (Ossipov et al., 2010).\r\nVR and Nonvenipuncture\r\n\r\nNumerous studies have consistently demonstrated the efficacy of VR for decreasing pain, distress, and anxiety, and reducing time spent thinking about pain during burn management and wound care (Das et al., 2005; Hoffman et al., 2000; Hoffman et al., 2008). Additionally, it was found that analgesia coupled with VR was more effective in reducing pain and distress than analgesia alone (Das et al., 2005). Earlier studies have also shown that VR can reduce the experience of pain (Schneider & Workman, 2000; Wint, Eshelman, Steele, & Guzzetta, 2002), physiological arousal (Gershon, et al., 2004), and procedure time (Schneider, Prince-Paul, Allen, Silverman, & Talaba, 2004; Schneider, et al., 2011) during common painful cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy infusions, lumbar puncture, and port access.\r\nVR and Venipuncture\r\n\r\nVenipuncture is an example of a common medical procedure that is routinely requested by doctors, and yet, often experienced as painful and distressing for children and adolescent patients (Fradet, McGrath, Kay, Adams, & Luke, 1990; Jacobson et al., 2001). To date, several small studies and few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have supported the theoretical foundation intimating promise for VR as a particularly effective nonpharmacological method of pain management during venipuncture procedures. One study examined the effect of using nonimmersive VR compared with standard of care (SOC) during a needle-related procedure on reported pain or distress of children and adolescents in a pediatric oncology unit and found that though there were no significant differences in pain or distress, children enjoyed the nonimmersive VR and were distracted during the venipuncture procedure (Nilsson, Finnström, Kokinsky, & Enskär, 2009). Gershon et al. (2004) compared the effects of immersive VR, nonimmersive VR, and no distraction during port access on pain and anxiety in child and adolescent patients. Children in immersive VR had significantly lower heart rates compared with the control group, while children in both immersive and nonimmersive VR received significantly lower nurse ratings of pain, but not self-report. Gold et al. (2005) investigated the use of VR distraction during pediatric outpatient blood draw, comparing pain and anxiety in four conditions: no distraction, cartoon distraction, VR via computer, or VR via HMD. Children in the VR HMD group reported a lower frequency of moderate-to-severe pain intensity levels compared with the other three groups. No significant differences were found in average pain intensity and state anxiety between the four conditions. Gold and colleagues (Gold et al., 2006) also compared VR with SOC (topical anesthetic) in children requiring intravenous placement of contrast for a magnetic resonance imaging CT scan. While children in the control condition had a fourfold increase in pain, children in the VR condition reported no significant changes in pain intensity between preintravenous and postintravenous placement. Furthermore, children, caregivers, and nurses were more satisfied with the use of VR for pain management during the procedure.\r\n\r\nEarly work in VR using older technology and preliminary evidence has demonstrated VR’s ability to reduce pain/distress in children and adolescents undergoing painful medication procedures. However, additional RCTs with newly developed VR technology and larger samples sizes are needed. Furthermore, it is important to include a multimodal assessment of the patient’s demographic and disease characteristics to more thoroughly understand the patient’s experience within the virtual gaming environment and to determine which patients benefit most from VR intervention. The current study used a randomized control trial (RCT) to examine the feasibility and efficacy of VR compared with SOC for reducing pain and anxiety in children and adolescent pediatric patients (10–21 years) undergoing blood draw. It was hypothesized that patients playing VR would experience significantly less pain and anxiety, and improved satisfaction according to patient, caregiver, and phlebotomist report. The study also examined individual patient characteristics to identify types of patients that benefit most from the VR intervention. The study used state-of-the-art VR technology in hopes to increase patient’s sense of presence within the virtual environment and increase the immersive-nature of the distraction. Preventing pain and anxiety during blood draw with VR has several important clinical implications including the prevention of future phobias related to medical interventions (e.g., needle phobia), medical trauma (i.e., posttraumatic stress disorder), improved patient cooperation with medical staff, and improved patient experience, thus leading to better child health outcomes.\r\nMaterials and Methods\r\nParticipants\r\n\r\nThe current study includes data from 143 child and adolescent patients (50.3% female; M (SD) age = 15.43 (3.13) years), their caregivers (mothers, fathers, and legal guardians) when patients were >18 years old, and their phlebotomists from the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Department of Pathology, a nonprofit pediatric, urban, university-based academic teaching hospital. Caregivers included 87 mothers (61%), 17 fathers (12%), and 3 other legal guardians. Thirty-six patients (25%) were >18 years old. Patients were eligible if they were scheduled to receive a blood draw, were between the ages of 10 and 21 years, and were English or Spanish speaking. Patients were excluded if they had a cognitive disability or developmental delay, a history of seizure, were currently taking pain or anxiety medication, had flu-like symptoms, or had a visual or auditory impairment that would interfere with their ability to use VR according to patient and caregiver report. The current sample is consistent with the hospital population in regard to ethnicity and medical status (Table I).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable I.\r\n\r\nDemographic Information\r\nVariable 	Total (N = 143) 	VR (n = 70) 	SOC (n = 73) 	Total (N = 143)\r\nM (SD)/% 	M (SD)/% 	M (SD)/% 	T/χ2 	p-value\r\nGender 	 	 	 	0.345 	.557\r\n Female 	50.34 	47.14 	52.05\r\n Male 	49.66 	52.86 	47.95\r\nAge 	15.43 (3.13) 	15.79 (3.00) 	15.06 (3.23) 	−1.37 	.173\r\nGrade 	9.71 (2.60) 	10.00 (2.81) 	9.43 (2.38) 	−1.10 	.27\r\nEthnicity 	 	 	 	9.97 	.126\r\n Latino/a 	60.0 	63.77 	56.06\r\n Caucasian 	20.7 	11.60 	30.30\r\n Asian/Pacific Islander 	8.1 	10.14 	6.06\r\n African-American 	3.0 	4.35 	1.51\r\n Biracial/multiracial 	4.4 	4.35 	4.55\r\n Other 	3.7 	5.80 	1.51\r\nMedical condition 	 	 	 	0.000 	1.00\r\n Yes 	39.7 	39.71 	39.71\r\n No 	60.3 	60.24 	60.24\r\nNumber of previous blood draws 	3.68 (6.08) 	4.46 (7.41) 	2.79 (3.93) 	−1.53 	.130\r\n\r\nProcedures\r\n\r\nStudy personnel approached patients and their families in the phlebotomy waiting room to determine interest and eligibility. Informed consent/assent was obtained from participants and their caregivers when the patient was a minor. Following consent, patients and their caregivers (when applicable) completed baseline measures about demographics and preprocedural pain and anxiety (∼5–10 min). Using a parallel group design, patients were then stratified by gender, and randomly assigned using a computer-generated randomization scheme to one of two conditions: (1) SOC or (2) SOC plus VR during their blood draw. Study personnel were blind to patient condition until after the baseline measures were completed (i.e., study personnel checked the condition on a document stored in a separate folder and then assigned participants to their condition). No study personnel involved in recruitment or assignment were involved in generating the randomization scheme. Patients in the VR condition received SOC and interacted with the VR game a few minutes before, during, and following the blood draw procedure (∼5 min total). Patients in the SOC condition received their blood draw according to SOC procedures only. SOC procedures involve brief interaction with the phlebotomist before the blood draw (i.e., asking for the patient’s birthdate and prepping for the procedure, followed by the blood draw). Each patient room has a television playing a cartoon movie at a low volume. Following the blood draw, patients, caregivers, and phlebotomists were asked to complete postprocedure measures about pain and anxiety during the procedure as well as satisfaction with the procedure/VR when applicable (∼5–10 min). The hospital’s institutional review board reviewed and approved all study procedures.\r\nVirtual Reality\r\n\r\nPatients assigned to the VR condition engaged with the VR game Bear Blast (appliedVR™) using the Samsung Galaxy S6 mobile-based Gear VR goggles (ages 13–21 years) or the Google Pixel mobile-based Merge VR goggles (ages 10–12 years). Different VR goggles were used for older and younger age groups based on the safety requirements outlined in the user’s manuals. In the multisensory (visual and auditory) immersive Bear Blast game, users travel on a preset path through a colorful, vibrant, highly interactive environment, filled with toy-like trees, mountains, rainbows, mushrooms, and bushes. As they gaze, they control the direction of a continuously firing cannon, which interacts with items in the world and positively reinforces experimentation and activity. They automatically enter a new level every 2.5 min, keeping the environment continuously fresh. Throughout the world, bears play the role of antagonist, standing in for the nuisance and distraction of pain. The VR game is equipped with a head-tracking system, enabling the player to look around the virtual environment, controlling the game with only movement of their head. Following the completion of every VR session, the removable face pad was replaced and the goggles and headsets were wiped down with alcohol-based sanitary wipes. Preventing infection via the sharing of the technology was a paramount issue with the study patients.\r\nMeasures\r\nDemographics\r\n\r\nCaregivers or patients ≥18 years completed a demographic form, which gathered information about age, grade, gender, ethnicity, medical diagnosis, and number of blood draws received in the past year.\r\nPain and Anxiety\r\n\r\nPatients and caregivers completed a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Colored Analogue Scale (CAS) ranging from 0 indicating “no pain” to 10 indicating “worst pain” to report on pain intensity preprocedure and postprocedure. Both also completed the Faces Pain Scale-Revised (Hicks et al., 2001) to measure affective pain (worry and bother related to pain) preprocedure and postprocedure. Anxiety was measured by patients and caregivers preprocedure and postprocedure using the VAS for anxiety and the Facial Affective Scale (FAS; McGrath et al., 1985).\r\nAnxiety Sensitivity\r\n\r\nPatients reported on their anxiety sensitivity using the Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI; Silverman, Fleisig, Rabian, & Peterson, 1991) preprocedure (α = .86). The 18-item measure uses a three-point Likert scale (none, some, a lot) to rate how negatively patients view anxiety symptoms (e.g., “It scares me when my heart beats fast”). Items are summed with a higher score indicating greater anxiety sensitivity. Previous studies have supported the reliability and validity of the CASI (Muris, Schmidt, Merckelbach, & Schouten, 2001; Silverman et al., 1991).\r\nSatisfaction\r\n\r\nPostprocedure, patients in the VR condition completed the investigator-developed Child Presence Measure to assess the degree of immersion in the game (Likert scale 1 “No,” 2 “A little,” or 3 “A lot”; score range 0–32). The 12-item measure asked children to respond to items related to three content domains: sense of involvement, perceived realism of VR game, and sense of transportation into the experience. Patients in the VR condition completed a Malaise Scale (Likert scale 1 “No nausea” to 6 “Sick”) to measure simulator sickness related to the VR game. Patients and their caregivers in both conditions also completed an investigator-developed Satisfaction questionnaire to assess satisfaction with the blood draw procedure, with the VR intervention if applicable, and solicit qualitative feedback. Phlebotomists also completed a five-item investigator-developed questionnaire postprocedure that asked about patient pain, anxiety, cooperation, and whether the phlebotomist was interested in using VR with their patients in the future.\r\nStatistical Analyses\r\nPower Analyses\r\n\r\nPower analyses based on preliminary data determined that at least 100 participants were needed to have 80% power to detect a medium-sized effect on pain and anxiety outcomes. The sample size was increased 40% to include the covariates of baseline pain/anxiety in each regression analysis and allow for detection of a smaller-sized effect.\r\nPatient Flow\r\n\r\nPatients, caregivers, and phlebotomists were recruited for the study from May 2016 to June 2017. Recruitment was concluded once a sample size with sufficient power to detect a medium-sized effect was obtained. As shown in Figure 1, of the 303 patients screened for study participation, 15% did not meet criteria and 36% declined to participate. The most common reasons for declining participation were related to lack of time. In total, 146 patients (48% of those eligible) were randomized to condition, and 143 patients (47%) had complete data and were included in the analyses.\r\nFigure 1.\r\nPatient flow diagram.\r\nView largeDownload slide\r\n\r\nPatient flow diagram.\r\nPatient flow diagram.\r\n\r\nPreliminary Analyses\r\n\r\nDescriptive statistics were used to characterize the study sample. T-tests and chi-squared analyses were used to compare demographic variables by condition. Bivariate correlations examined the relations between demographic variables (age; gender; number of past procedures) and anxiety sensitivity with the postprocedure pain and anxiety variables according to patient-report. Qualitative data about patient, caregiver, and phlebotomist satisfaction with VR, as well as immersion and simulator sickness are also presented.\r\nPrimary Analyses\r\n\r\nControlling for baseline pain/anxiety, linear regression analyses examined how condition (SOC vs. VR) predicted patient postprocedural pain/anxiety according to patient and caregiver report. Secondary analyses examined the moderating role of demographic or anxiety sensitivity variables found to be significantly related to postprocedure variables. Specifically, controlling for baseline pain/anxiety, linear regression analyses examined how condition (SOC vs. VR), the moderating variable, and the interaction between condition and the moderator, predicted postprocedure pain/anxiety according to patient report. Significant interactions were probed for further interpretation. T-tests compared phlebotomist-report of patient pain, anxiety, and cooperation during the blood draw in VR versus SOC conditions.\r\nResults\r\nPreliminary Analyses\r\n\r\nDescriptive statistics about demographic data and study variables are presented in Tables I andII, respectively. There were no significant group differences in age, grade, gender, number of previous blood draws, or ethnicity (all p-values >.12; Table I). Bivariate correlations showed that gender (coded 0 = female, 1 = male) was significantly related to procedural pain (as measured by the Pain VAS and Faces Pain Scale-Revised; r = −.22, p < .05 and r = −.25, p < .01), anxiety (as measured by the Anxiety VAS; r = −.18, p < .05), and affect (as measured by the FAS; r = −.24, p < .01). Age was significantly related to procedural pain (as measured by the Pain VAS, r = −.20, p < .05; Pain CAS, r = −.17, p < .05; and Faces Pain scale, r = −.21, p < .05). Anxiety sensitivity significantly related to higher procedural anxiety (Anxiety VAS, r = .20, p < .05). Grade, ethnicity, and number of previous blood draws were not significantly related to any procedural pain or anxiety variable according to patient-report.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable II.\r\n\r\nDescriptive Statistics on Study Variables by Report and Condition\r\nMeasure 	Patient-report M (SD) 	Caregiver-report M (SD)\r\nVR (n = 70) 	SOC (n = 73) 	VR (n = 52) 	SOC (n = 49)\r\nPain VAS 	1.31 (1.59) 	1.93 (2.22) 	1.06 (1.72) 	2.26 (2.68)\r\nPain Color Analogue Scale 	1.58 (2.02) 	2.00 (2.10) 	1.19 (1.57) 	2.29 (2.38)\r\nFaces Pain Scale—Revised 	1.40 (.73) 	1.70 (1.13) 	1.54 (88) 	2.02 (1.30)\r\nAnxiety VAS 	1.90 (2.22) 	2.48 (2.07) 	1.52 (2.03) 	2.48 (2.63)\r\nFAS 	0.28 (0.22) 	0.40 (.24) 	0.33 (0.22) 	0.38 (0.25)\r\n\r\nFAS = Facial Affective Scale; VAS = Visual Analogue Scale.\r\n\r\nIn terms of satisfaction with the VR game, patients reported high levels of immersion (M (SD) = 22.75 (6.32). In total, 92% of patients in the VR condition reported no simulator sickness. Four patients (5.2%) reported mild to moderate nausea during the VR game. Beyond simulator sickness, no other adverse events were reported. Phlebotomists reported that they thought that the VR helped and that they wanted to use VR with other patients 98% of the time. One patient in the VR condition reported that the VR “keeps your mind busy and away from the needle. It made it easier and faster.” Another patient explained that he was “nervous at the idea of blood draw, however the VR game truly helped distract [him] from the feeling of the needle being inserted.” One caregiver stated that he “[wished his son] could do this every time he has a blood draw. He actually smiled coming out.” Another caregiver explained that she “[likes] it because [she thinks] that kids focus not on the blood draw/needle, but focus on the game. They forget about the needle.”\r\nPrimary Analyses\r\n\r\nControlling for baseline levels, patients in the VR condition experienced significantly less procedural pain (as measured by the Pain VAS), procedural anxiety (as measured by the Anxiety VAS), and had significantly better affect (as measured by the FAS) during the blood draw procedure compared with the SOC condition according to both patient and caregiver-report (small, but practically significant effects; Ferguson, 2009; Table III). Secondary analyses examined the potential moderating role of VR goggle-type, age, gender, number of previous blood draws, and anxiety sensitivity based on the significant correlations. Regression results demonstrated a significant interaction between anxiety sensitivity (as measured by the CASI) and condition in predicting patient procedural anxiety (b (SE) = −.13 (.05), β = −.46, p = .006; a moderate effect; Ferguson, 2009). Probing the interaction showed that when anxiety sensitivity was low (1 SD below the mean), there was no significant difference in anxiety between groups (b = .015, β = .004, p = .97). However, when anxiety sensitivity was high (1 SD above the mean), patients in the VR condition experienced significantly less anxiety compared with SOC (b = −1.66, β = −.39, p < .001; Figure 2). This finding suggests that patients with high anxiety sensitivity benefit more from the VR intervention. VR goggle-type, age, gender, and number of previous blood draws did not significantly moderate effects of VR during blood draw on any procedural pain or anxiety variables according to patient report (all p-values > .14). There were no significant differences by condition in procedural pain, anxiety, or cooperation according to phlebotomist-report (all p-values > .16).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable III.\r\n\r\nRegression Results Comparing Effect of VR Versus SOC on Patient Pain and Anxiety Outcomes\r\nMeasure 	Patient-report M (SD) 	Caregiver-report M (SD)\r\nb (SE) 	β 	p-value 	b (SE) 	β 	p-value\r\nPain VAS\r\n Pain VAS Pre 	.31 (.09) 	0.29 	.001 	0.58 (0.13) 	0.42 	<.001\r\n Condition 	−.62 (.32) 	−0.16 	.053 	−1.09 (0.41) 	−0.24 	<.01\r\nPain Color Analogue Scale\r\n Pain CAS Pre- 	.48 (.07) 	0.54 	<.001 	0.42 (0.09) 	0.42 	<.001\r\n Condition 	−.50 (.30) 	−0.12 	.095 	−1.05 (0.36) 	−0.26 	<.01\r\nFaces Pain Scale—Revised\r\n Faces Pre- 	.45 (.07) 	0.47 	< .001 	0.53 (0.11) 	0.42 	<.001\r\n Condition 	−.29 (.14) 	−0.15 	<.05 	−0.38 (0.21) 	−0.17 	.07\r\nAnxiety VAS\r\n Anxiety VAS Pre- 	.50 (.06) 	0.59 	< .001 	0.46 (0.07) 	0.53 	<.001\r\n Condition 	−.82 (.30) 	−0.19 	<.01 	−1.23 (0.40) 	−0.26 	<.01\r\nFAS\r\n FAS Pre- 	.57 (.07) 	0.55 	< .001 	0.50 (0.08) 	0.54 	<.001\r\n Condition 	−.13 (.03) 	−0.27 	<.001 	−0.09 (0.04) 	−0.19 	<.05\r\n\r\nNote.

This trial marks the first RCT examining the new generation of VR technology on a defined population of children undergoing blood draw, and a game designed to assist patients with pain and anxiety management during painful medical procedures (Bear Blast by appliedVR™). Additionally, this study uniquely gathered qualitative information about pain management satisfaction from the patient, the caregiver, and the phlebotomist. Finally, the current study is the first VR RCT to examine the moderating influences of patient characteristics on the effects of VR. Given the public’s excitement and enthusiasm for VR and its applications, specifically in health care, this article marks a critical first step in the examination of the new generation of VR technology for acute procedural pain management.\r\n\r\nThe proposed hypotheses were supported by the data, consistent with previous research examining VR in burn care (Das et al., 2005; Hoffman et al., 2000; Hoffman et al., 2001) and during routine medical procedures (Gold et al., 2006). Patients randomized to VR experienced significantly less pain and anxiety, and significantly better affect, as measured by patients and caregivers, compared with SOC. VR was more effective for children with higher anxiety sensitivity. Specifically, children using VR who were more distressed by physiological feelings of anxiety, experienced significantly less anxiety compared with those patients with lower anxiety sensitivity or receiving SOC. Patients reported high levels of immersion associated with the Bear Blast and few reported any negative side effects, such as simulator sickness or nausea. Patient, caregiver, and phlebotomist satisfaction scores demonstrated that all three groups recognized the value in VR, reported high levels of satisfaction, would consider using VR again, and would recommend that other patients try VR.\r\n\r\nThe current findings suggest that VR is not as straightforward and simple as investigators and clinicians have believed. Individual differences and patient characteristics do appear to impact the effects of VR on pain perception/experience as a function of anxiety sensitivity. The complex nature of VR for attenuating pain during a routine medical procedure, blood draw, does appear to be influenced specifically by factors not previously explored in the early VR studies. In support of previous research examining the effects of VR on physiological arousal (Gershon, et al., 2004), it appears that patients with the greatest amount of anxiety sensitivity, in particular discomfort with symptoms of physiological arousal (e.g., increased heart rate), benefit the most from the VR intervention. This contribution begins to delineate some of VR’s unique contributions to reducing pain and overall distress/anxiety. While the current study supports the efficacy of VR across age, gender, and previous experience with blood draw during blood draw, future VR research will continue to benefit from the investigation of patient (age; gender; ethnicity), disease (numbers of procedures; medication; diagnosis), and environmental (virtual environment; immersion) characteristics that may alter the benefit of VR and that are unique to the population of study and the types of virtual environments used to improve patient health outcomes.\r\n\r\nPatient satisfaction has recently become a beacon and driving force for examining clinic/hospital clinical performance and identifying clinical excellence. As such, VR may be uniquely positioned to influence both the patient and the patient’s caregiver’s experience/satisfaction with overall health care, while decreasing common anxieties and pain/fears associated with blood draw or other routine medical procedures. Additionally, health-care provider satisfaction is critical in patient outcomes, minimizing job burnout, fatigue, and compassion fatigue, resulting in low turnover, and overall job satisfaction (Kalliath & Morris, 2002).\r\n\r\nThe field of VR, although gaining tremendous popularity, is faced with a weakness from a scientific standpoint. Most VR innovators are offering the gaming consoles and platforms as frontline interventions for children and adults without conducting any pilot studies or clinical trials to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, or effectiveness. Although the current findings may generalize to other patients undergoing blood draw, more conservatively, these results apply to children engaging in Bear Blast (appliedVR™) using the mobile-based Samsung Gear VR or Google Merge VR goggles. Other limitations include the nature of self-, caregiver-, and phlebotomist-reported outcomes as well as the lack of blinding of study personnel during postprocedure measures. Future studies may benefit from the inclusion of physiological, biological, and other objective outcome measures. In addition, participants reported generally low pain levels during the blood draw procedure. Future research with larger sample sizes could explore additional variables that may moderate the effectiveness of VR for the prevention and amelioration of pain and anxiety during similar or more painful medical procedures. Further, generalizability of findings may be limited, given the 36% of potential participants who declined participation (most often because of time constraints), which could suggest selection bias, as those who chose to participate may have different characteristics compared with those who declined. Finally, it is important to consider why there were no significant differences by condition in procedural pain, anxiety, or cooperation according to phlebotomist-report. While phlebotomists’ reported high satisfaction with the VR intervention, they also reported that the patients did well during SOC. From a social desirability standpoint, phlebotomists may wish to appear competent in their job performance or they may be less able to report on the subjective experience of their patients.\r\n\r\nInvestigating the efficacy of the new VR technologies (circa 2016) and software for a variety of medical procedures and preventive care in pediatric patients has far-reaching implications for the use of VR within medical centers and clinic settings. VR for managing procedural pain and distress may be a natural complement to SOC while improving the patient experience. Specific strengths associated with VR as a medical intervention are that it has low costs (the cost of a smartphone plus a VR head mount ranging from $13 to $500), is easily accessible and available to patients and families with smartphones, and young patients are becoming increasingly comfortable with new technologies. Potential challenges for the utility of VR in a hospital setting include hospital buy-in and staff availability to manage the technology, and, most critically, the need to maintain exemplary hygiene practices to minimize/eliminate infection associated with patients sharing the technology. Though it should only take moments to set up VR games for patients in need, the additional time needed to maintain appropriate hygiene could add extra demand in the midst of a busy hospital unit. Evidence-based support for nonpharmacological interventions, such as VR, may lead to improved procedural pain management, decreased need for pharmacological interventions with known adverse side effects (e.g., narcotics; sedatives; anxiolytics; Sharar et al., 2007), increased procedural cooperation, higher caregiver and health-care provider satisfaction, and improved health outcomes for patients. Ultimately, the aim of future contemporary VR investigations should continue to develop flexible VR environments targeting specific acute and chronic pain conditions, and to promote long-term rehabilitative pain management. As new VR technology becomes more readily available, affordable, and socially acceptable, it may be a natural complement to SOC for managing procedural pain and distress while improving the patient experience. The advancement of VR in addition to SOC for pediatric pain management surrounding routine painful medical procedures, particularly for highly anxious patients, could potentially ameliorate the pain and distress experienced in pediatric medical settings, while preventing fear that may interfere with future routine procedures and medical care. While VR may have preventive care implications, many new technology and virtual environments are yet to be examined. The future of VR is now, intonating great promise and wide application. However, it is our scientific responsibility to investigate its applications and determine the best match for VR in managing acute procedural pain management and other health-related conditions.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nThe authors would like to acknowledge appliedVR™ for their support of the trial; the research staff Adriana Cabrales, Raquel Engilman Sloane Fisher, Melody Hannani, Arianna Lane, Ezie Nguyen, and Reina Factor; the staff and leadership in the Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, Department of Pathology; and the participating children and their families.\r\nFunding\r\n\r\nThis work was supported by applied VR™ for the purposes of staff and technology support.\r\n\r\nConflict of Interest: Jeffrey I.

INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nVirtual reality and video games are becoming a part of everyday life. Computer games are provided with game-level editors (GLE), which allow the user to create customized virtual environments (VE). In a therapeutic framework, GLE\'s VEs combined with virtual reality have been used in many fields including psychotherapy. The present article comprises two studies. In the first study, criteria for selecting the most relevant GLE for the construction of interactive VEs are outlined. During the second study, the selected GLE was utilized to construct 9 distinct virtual situations in which a sample of 18 agoraphobics were immersed. Within each VE, the participants contended with their least feared situation and their most feared one. Questionnaires and physiological measures demonstrated increased levels of presence and anxiety within the feared VEs. There was a significant correlation between presence and anxiety. These data indicate that GLE\'s interactive worlds combined with VR offers a viable possibility to establish a therapeutic environment at an affordable cost.\r\n\r\nFrom the Magnavox Odyssey, the first home video game console (1972), to the successive generation of computers and game consoles (Intellivision, Colecovision, Amstrad, Amiga, PlayStation, PC ...), to our contemporary computers, a great leap toward realism and performance in video games has been accomplished. Nowadays, immersive video games are part of our culture and everyday life. Even though games, and more specifically computer games, are widely considered as a means of entertainment, they can also provide useful tools for education ([22]; [37]), in training as a way of acquiring procedures and skills ([ 7]; [ 9]; [23]), in medicine as a way of physical rehabilitation of specific gestures or impairment ([ 3]; [ 8]) and in psychology for the treatment of diverse disorders ([ 6]; [42]). Thus, places and situations exploited for a clinical trial can be derived from environments already present in the software ([40]) or elaborated using the game-level editor (GLE) provided by the game company ([29]).\r\n\r\nStill, it should be noted that contemporary computer media and technology for everyday use of video games such as monitor or TV, joystick, and paddle are still rather limited in terms of sensory involvement and input/output information. Although some game platforms such as the Nintendo Wii have introduced the use of a motion tracker as an input for kinesthesia, the user is still free to look around and notice that she or he is remains outside the virtual environment (VE). This disconnection limits ipso facto a more profound involvement into the computerized world, hindering extrapolation of hypothesis and fettering the feeling of \"being there\" widely defined as the sense of presence ([16]).\r\n\r\nTo immerse individuals into 3D virtual worlds and to overcome the aforementioned issues as well as to exploit a new media for man–machine relationships, virtual reality (VR) emerged as early as the 1960s ([36]). This antinomic term, virtual reality, refers to a collection of technologies (e.g., computer, head-mounted display, trackers, interfaces) that allow individuals to interact efficiently and intuitively with a three-dimensional real-time VE using natural senses and skills. Thus, it can be regarded as a novel human–computer interaction paradigm where the user is an active participant ([27]). The dramatic advances in computer science, hardware performance, the emergence of VR, and the reduction in material cost allow the use of 3D VEs for psychological research and therapy. Indeed, in psychotherapy, some experimental protocols require an ecological environment, that is, an experience as close as possible to the real world with all the sensory characteristics and physical parameters implied. These realistic features could represent a direct step in order to generate and verify theories that can be extrapolated to the reality and applied to the population of patients.\r\n\r\nYet creation of realistic VEs for a clinical trial or a therapeutic protocol involves a wide range of expertise. It may require a team qualified in advanced programming and scripting skills, experience in conceiving game engine, graphic work and character design, animation sequence, sounds conception, and beta testing. This process necessarily involves notable cost in term of financial support and time. Nowadays, development of VR software or a computer game exploiting the potential of contemporary PCs with the state-of-the art realistic graphics may cost millions of U.S. dollars and require hundreds of professionals. To circumvent such ordeals, several research teams have successfully employed VEs created from existing off-the-shelves games. The use of affordable level editors provided with existing games considerably lowers the time and cost of VE development and makes possible the setup of experiments involving complex and vivid 3D VEs and VR.\r\n\r\nIn the last decade GLEs combined with VR equipment and features have been proven to be efficient in the treatment of phobias ([ 5]; [18]; [28]). In these VEs, reality is replaced by artificially created stimuli inside a computerized world. Such process is called virtual-reality-based exposure therapy, and these procedures aim, through confrontation, at habituation to conditioning stimuli and fear extinction, just as traditional cognitive behavioral methods ([30])but in a more flexible and controllable environment than reality.\r\n\r\nIn the same vein, utilizing VR and an affordable GLE, the present clinical trial developed and tested VEs elaborated for the exposure and treatment of subjects suffering from anxiety disorders, and more specifically agoraphobia.\r\n\r\nAgoraphobia is defined as the fear of being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult or embarrassing ([ 1]). This implies the fear of a wide array of situations or places: driving, going out or being in the crowd, being in a supermarket, on a plane, on a train, on a bridge, in a lift, or any enclosed spaces, or simply being alone. As these situations are quite common in daily life, agoraphobia can be considered as an impairing and disabling mental disorder, and in severe cases agoraphobics can even be homebound. Agoraphobia was selected to review, determine, and assess different GLEs, for it is the phobia that features the most various avoided situations among all phobias. If a versatile GLE can create all the VEs required for its treatment, we infer that it is very likely it will be able to construct VE for diverse psychological disorders. Moreover, agoraphobia shared several of these places with other phobias (flying phobia, driving phobia, claustrophobia ...). Finally, the GLE used must allow a sole experimenter with experience of graphic design to create all these environments without the need of programming.\r\n\r\nTo this day, several clinical studies demonstrated the efficiency of VR exposure for treatment of patients suffering from agoraphobia with or without panic disorder ([ 4]; [39]). Yet the VEs used were built using in-house engines and programs developed by a reduced number of skilled personnel. This raises the cost and results in the production of limited VEs by today\'s standard when compared to expensive VR program (e.g., Virtools) or simply modern video games available on the market. Alternatively, free program such as NeuroVR 2.0 allows clinicians or researchers to construct therapeutic VEs. However, these free programs cannot offer the graphics quality or the object database of a GLE. Last, the recent version of another free program called Unity possesses a modern and powerful graphic engine with free downloadable content and assets database but requires a proper training in design and skills in C# programming language.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the present article includes two studies to address the evoked contemporary issue. The first study searched and compared distinct GLEs prior to the creation of realistic VEs used in the development of virtual-reality-based exposure therapy for phobic subjects such as agoraphobics. Once the GLE was selected, all required VEs were elaborated and their immersiveness as well as their ability to induce stress among agoraphobics investigated through the second study involving a sample of 18 subjects diagnosed with agoraphobia. The immersion and anxiety induced by the VEs were assessed by self report questionnaire as well as objective physiological measures such as heart rate and heart rate variability.\r\n2. STUDY 1\r\n\r\n2.1. Objectives\r\n\r\nBefore selecting the most relevant GLE for constructing VEs, the objectives were exposed to carefully individualize the parameters needed for the VEs aimed to treat anxiety disorders such as agoraphobia.\r\n\r\nThe goal of the Study 1 was to determine which GLE is efficient and advanced enough to generate versatile environments for the treatment of complex anxiety disorders such as agoraphobia.\r\n2.2. Methods\r\n\r\nProcedure\r\n\r\nEight different commercially available GLEs were screened by comparing crucial features related to the construction of VE for virtual-reality-based exposure therapy. Screening and tests of each GLEs were performed by the first author. These programs were acquired and their features assessed by building a preliminary VE or, where indicated, were used in previous experiments involving the first author. These features are listed infra.\r\nGLEs\' Requirements for Therapy\r\n\r\nDuring virtual-reality-based exposure therapy, VEs aim to immerse the participants into a reality-like situation with striking effects eliciting presence. Therefore, it is a critical matter to employ a graphics engine that is able to manage complex 3D features, interaction, physics, and virtual humans. To mimic properties of human biometry, first-person shooter GLEs are therefore the logical choice to obtain these properties.\r\n\r\nFollowing results from previous articles and empirical works cited hereafter, eight crucial characteristics were distinguished to evaluate the feasibility of VE creation for virtual-reality-based exposure therapy:\r\n\r\n    • First-person view. First, the engine should deliver humanoid vision (eye-level height of view, field of view). Indeed, first-person view is considered as more immersive than an external point of view ([16]).\r\n\r\n    • Next-generation mapping (high-resolution textures, bump mapping, normal mapping, etc.). This adds exquisite details to textures for better rendering and allows the user to examine objects details at a close distance such as it is rated in the Presence Questionnaire (PQ; [44]). A previous study comparing the effects of a low-resolution VE to a high-resolution VE revealed that the high-resolution/high-tech VEs group reported a more sturdy illusion of presence than the low-resolution/low-tech group ([10]). In addition, next-generation mapping enhance the realism of the VEs. Normal map mimics the feeling of relief, which contributed to presence when compared to plane textures ([32]).\r\n\r\n    • Contemporary Objects database. GLE\'s 3D objects library and database should include numerous realistic entities for the VE design. It is critical that entities consist of contemporary objects as virtual-reality-based exposure therapy involves the confrontation to a situation taking place in the present time. Indeed, futuristic or medieval items commonly found in video games may alter the realistic aspect of the virtual immersion.\r\n\r\n    • Advanced artificial intelligence (AI). AI is the entity that manages the behavior of virtual humans or characters. Their presence is indispensable in prompting the participant to think that the VE is aware, real, and alive and avoid the notion of being alone in a VE ([21]), which could impair the perceived presence. To maintain the illusion of reality, advanced AI need to behave as closely as possible to real human and must exhibit a cluster of scripted or random reactions such as walking, driving, random gestures, dynamic gaze, reacting to the presence of the participant when bumping, and so forth. Moreover, for phobias treatment purposes, to control a crowd of virtual humans or simply the behavior of a virtual passenger on an airplane during therapeutic exposure, the interface must allow the experimenter to customize specific behaviors without programming skills.\r\n\r\n    • Interaction with the milieu. Interaction underlies the idea that the participant can affect and change the environment by their action ([35]). The naturalness of interaction with VE is deemed to confer the ability to become immerse and is one of the main factor of presence ([16]).\r\n\r\n    • Dynamic shadows. Shadows on static and moving objects have been found to influence higher reported levels of presence in a VE ([34]).\r\n\r\n    • Drivable vehicle. As agoraphobics considered driving on highway or in tunnels stressful, it is mandatory that the GLE is able to manage the navigation of vehicle such as cars. Moreover, the presence of AI driving cars can add realism to an urban space.\r\n\r\n    • Virtual body. A user\'s body 3D representation in a VE has been proven to increase the perceived presence in a VE ([33]) and can contribute to the efficiency of the immersion.\r\n\r\nStudy of the GLEs\r\n\r\nGame editors, and particularly level-design game editors, coming from mainstream games developed for the international gaming market possess powerful 3D engines, compatible with a large array of PC hardware (graphic cards, navigation interfaces), software/configuration, or VR equipment (first-person view for head-mounted display, mouse motion for head movement, etc.). Although they are rather inexpensive (from $10 to $60 USD), their graphics, animation, and realistic features can challenge professional software as their aim is to immerse the player in a 3D environment. The content of the game can be modified and customized. Any objects can be imported using free graphic application such as Blender. This customization is called user-made modification or Mod. Mod possibilities range from slight change (e.g., sequence and rules) to a total conversion. Therefore, to respect the protocol economic constraint, different affordable GLEs exploiting the engine of commercial games have been considered using the aforementioned criteria and needs.\r\nGmax Tempest\r\n\r\nIn October 2001, the Discreet Company has issued a free version of an editor called Gmax Tempest. This software derived from Gmax, a lightened version of 3D Studio Max developed by the same company, can provide tools to generate levels and maps using the Quake III game engine.\r\n\r\nWe have utilized this editor to create a VE needed for the MD thesis viva ([17]). This free editor can produce 3D polygonal textured objects and comply with human biometry. However, it is now limited as it included low-resolution textures and cannot handle complicated visual effects. In addition, there are no clear recommendations with respect to avatar\'s AI control.\r\nUnrealED 3.0\r\n\r\nUnrealED 3.0 from Epic Game Inc. is the editor of the worldwide famous game Unreal Tournament 2003/2004 using the Unreal Engine 2.0. This editor is provided along with the affordable game ($20–$30 USD). In 2006, we used this editor to generate nine anxiety-graded VEs for claustrophobic participants in the framework of a clinical trial ([18]).\r\n\r\nThe success of the latter assay proved that this editor was sophisticated enough to induce presence in the subjects and obtained significant therapeutic outcomes. Moreover, the editor supports some of the specified requirements just listed. We have recently retested this editor. It might be exploited for the present study; however, it shows diverse downsides. To begin with, this editor does not propose recent \"next-generation\" game editor advantages. Indeed, UnrealED 3.0 does not feature detailed dynamic shadows or materials with bump mapping. It is also regrettable that the 3D objects database contains many anachronic objects due to the content of the game (antique Egypt, future worlds, uchronic places, etc.). In addition, users had no virtual body in the VEs. This was observed by some participants who, when looking down, considered the absence of their virtual feet odd and inappropriate.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, many avatars are not human beings. This can be solved through custom making of 3D objects or avatars using external graphics applications (e.g., Blender, Autodesk 3Dmax, or Maya) and graphic editing programs (e.g., Paint.Net, etc.), but these procedures are time consuming and irrelevant considering the aforementioned issues (Figure 1).\r\n\r\nGraph: FIG. 1. A screenshot of the VE created for our past clinical trial using UnrealED 3.0 ([18]). Note. Note the absence of deep shadows on objects.\r\nUnrealED 4.0\r\n\r\nUnrealED 4.0 from Epic Games Inc., issued in November 2007, is the following iteration of UnrealED 3.0 and is provided with the game Unreal Tournament 3. It released with the Unreal Engine 3.0. Although low priced ($60 USD), the UnrealED 4.0 is a modern editor making the most of its powerful game engine. It features most of the study technological constraints: materials with detailed textures and bump mapping, dynamic shadows, first-personal view, avatars with detailed faces and ex<x>pressions.\r\n\r\nWe exploited and analyzed the editor and its features, building a preliminary VE. Although exhibiting the aforementioned advantages, the use of the editor has unveiled some weaknesses. Indeed, the editor is, in certain occasions, unstable and could crash during its use. It also suffered from the same inconvenience regarding the 3D objects\' databases than the previous iteration id est anachronic objects, unrealistic avatars\' textures and some nonhuman characters.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the weakest point is the involution of the avatar AI control system and behavior sequence. The new graphic user interface, although very convenient for building VEs, lacks AI modules. Avatars are unable to comply with simple instructions, and their locomotion is limited to run (no walking animations). These could be corrected by elaborating custom modules. These procedures required scripting and coding in C++ that is difficult for a mere designer with medical/psychology background (Figure 2).\r\n\r\nMAP: FIG. 2. Screenshot of the preliminary test map made for our study using the recent UnrealED 4.0. Note. Notice the visual effects, the quality of the 3D objects rendering and the impression of relief on textures.\r\nUnrealED 4.0 (Gears of War Version)\r\n\r\nGears of War is a tactical third-person shooter video game developed by Epic Games Inc. It employs the same engine as Unreal III (the Unreal Engine 3.0) and the same editor, but the 3D objects database is specific and defined as more realistic than Unreal III. Moreover, the AI is more flexible as this software was a single-player game, making necessary to generate avatars with more complex AI features than Unreal III. Nonetheless, it became rapidly clear that the editor presents a serious flaw for clinical use: The camera view is a third-person view (the user\'s body is seen from an external point of view), impeding considerably the immersive qualities of the software. This severe disadvantage could not be corrected using the editor.\r\nValve Hammer 4.0\r\n\r\nValve Hammer is the map editor of the well-known game Half-life 2 (and Counter Strike) from Valve Software Inc. Released in 2004 along with the game, the rather modern editor exploits the Source game engine and the physics Engine Havok, which generates realistic physics events and properties. Tests demonstrated that it provides most of the aforementioned technological requirements. Moreover, the 3D objects library contains many contemporary realistic entities. Avatars\' appearances and textures are relevant for the trial as well, and most of the avatars are humans.\r\n\r\nPast experimental studies used the previous iteration of this editor for the treatment of people suffering from arachnophobia ([ 5]). This experiment was successful: Not only did the participants express presence, but the questionnaires revealed a significant reduction of the phobia symptoms. Other trials have supported the presence inducing capabilities with phobic participants using the previous iteration of the Valve hammer ([29]). Nevertheless, being released in 2004, its graphical capabilities start to be limited (Figure 3).\r\n\r\nGraph: FIG. 3. Screenshot of the Valve hammer editor. Note. Now relatively dated, this editor contains realistic objects database and advanced visual effects, and has been used with success in a clinical trial related to arachnophobia ([ 5]).\r\nElder Scroll Construction Set\r\n\r\nThe Elder Scrolls Construction Set is the editing software for the video game The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. This software is of peculiar interest as, conversely to the other GLEs derived from first-person shooters, it is embedded in an adventure game. The construction was considered as an interesting alternative as the game features immersive aspects: first-person view, advanced AI with dialogue capabilities, a useful tool to quickly create complex interiors of buildings (the Cell View), an advanced graphics engine (GameBryo) that enables high-end texturing, advanced particle effects, level of details representations customizable materials, a powerful and notable physics engine (Havok) that generates realistic physics events and properties, and a specific trees and foliage rendering software (SpeedTree).\r\n\r\nAfter investigation, it was concluded that given the complete absence of contemporary objects library (most of the 3D objects stocked in the files are medieval-like, e.g., castles, mansions, pavises, ballistas, etc.) and materials (for clothes or objects), the creation of such numerous assets from scratch will be compulsory. In addition, the editor exhibits the almost impossible use of any kind of vehicles.\r\nMaxED 2.0\r\n\r\nMaxED 2.0 is Remedy\'s proprietary-level editor, and it is an integral part of the toolset created to develop the game Max Payne 2. The game was released in October 2003, and its editor, MaxED 2.0, can be freely downloaded. It exploits the MAX-FX 2.0 engine. Cote et al. successfully utilized this editor to construct VEs for research purposes. The aim of their study was to verify the psychophysiological responses of arachnophobic participants confronted with the VEs built by the editor ([10]).\r\n\r\nThe editor offers many advantages: 3D objects with high polygon count, high-resolution textures with shaders (for reflection effects), human avatars with facial animations, advanced physics engine for better rigid bodies rendering (gravity, collision, etc.), and a rich 3D objects database that contain abundant realistic and contemporary objects (Figure 4).\r\n\r\nGraph: FIG. 4. A screenshot of the The Elder Scrolls Construction Set shows a virtual environment set up for an experiment related to learning and music ([26]) (Shot courtesy of Eric Fassbender).\r\n\r\nEven though this is a third-person-view game, after testing, it was discovered that the editor may change the user\'s point of view for more immersive purposes. A noteworthy characteristic was the existence of the user\'s virtual body in the editor. The presence of user\'s virtual body enables her or him to see her or his own 3D corpse. Albeit powerful and realistic, the engine dates back to 2003 and does not include modern realistic features. Indeed, there is no normal mapping textures, no fluid physics, and no interaction with vehicles (no driving), and the facilities to create large environment are unclear.\r\nSandbox 2\r\n\r\nSandbox 2 is the level editor of the game Crysis exploiting the CryEngine 2 game engine developed by Crytek GmbH. The game and the editor included were issued in November 2007. Because the engine seemed resourceful, advanced, and promising, we tested the inexpensive ($60 USD) level editor and constructed a preliminary VE.\r\n\r\nThe Sandbox 2 editor features a first-person view, detailed high-resolution materials (textures blended with other layers such as shaders or specular), real-time dynamic lighting and shadows, visual effects (motion blur), complex physics engine including fluid properties and rigid bodies, a large 3D realistic and contemporary objects database, human avatars with facial animations, large map creation capabilities, and the possibility to drive vehicles.\r\n\r\nBecause the Crysis game was developed as a single-player game, the avatar AI system provides simple to complex behavior (walk, run, move to a point, drive vehicle, play animation, look at target, etc.). These behaviors could be set using a graphical user interface, which avoids the intricacy of using C++ programming language. In the same vein as MaxEd, the Sandbox2 allows the user to see his or her own virtual body (Figures 5 and 6).\r\n\r\nGraph: FIG. 5. A screenshot of the editor MaxED 2.0. Note. Observe the realistic environment and objects as well as the avatar shadow. This program has been utilized with achievement in a clinical trial related to arachnophobia ([10]).\r\n\r\nGraph: FIG. 6. Screenshots of 4 VEs built with the Sandbox 2 for the present study. Note. Note the high-resolution textures, the lighting effects, the high range rendering shadows, the avatar attitude, and the contemporary 3D objects including a drivable vehicle (supermarket, highway, subway, and an airplane cabin).\r\n\r\nGraph\r\n\r\nGraph\r\n\r\nGraph\r\nNeuro VR 2\r\n\r\nNeuroVR 2.0 is a free application based on open source components and contains a VE editor. It is not a GLE per se and was released well after the beginning of the study (November 2010); it was tested here for future reference only. After some investigations, the editor was able to generate various interactive VEs, with many domestic contemporary objects, lights effects, and shadows. Its simplicity of use and intuitive interface make it accessible to clinicians with basic computer skills. However, there is no avatar AI and animation control (walk, look, etc.), users had no virtual body, the engine does not support normal/bump mapping, and there are no vehicle-driving capabilities.\r\n2.3. Results: Comparisons of Critical Factors\r\n\r\nTable 1 includes each GLE considered and sums up the presence or absence of needed requirements for creating VEs used in the context of virtual-reality-based exposure therapy. The comparison of the GLEs revealed several aspects. All the programs allow the user to interact with the milieu. Although most of them feature first-person view, next-generation mapping, and dynamic shadow, only five let the users drive the vehicle themselves. Half of the GLEs offer contemporary objects in their database, and a limited number of them—Valve Hammer, Sandbox and Elder scrolls CS—proffer advanced AI that controls virtual humans in a diverse manner. Along these lines, just two of the GLEs (Sandbox and MaxEd) permit the navigation with a virtual body. Finally, only the Sandbox 2 Editor exhibited all the critical features listed in Table 1.\r\n\r\nTABLE 1 Summary of the Main Features Essential to the Elaboration of Virtual Environments Used for the Treatment of Agoraphobia\r\n\r\nFeatures GLE	FPV	NGM	CO	AAI	VB	IM	DV	DS\r\nGmaxTempest	O	—	—	—	—	O	—	—\r\nUnrealED 3.0	O	—	—	—	—	O	O	—\r\nUnrealED 4.0 ut	O	O	—	—	—	O	O	O\r\nUnrealED 4.0 gw	—	O	—	—	—	O	O	O\r\nValve Hammer 4.0	O	O	O	O	—	O	O	O\r\nElder Scrolls CS	O	O	—	O	—	O	—	O\r\nMaxED 2.0	—	—	O	—	O	O	—	O\r\nSandbox 2	O	O	O	O	O	O	O	O\r\nNeuroVR 2.0	O	—	O	—	—	O	—	O\r\nNote.

Discussion\r\n\r\nIn this first study, the review of literature pertaining to presence and virtual reality allowed us to determine the relevant features for creating VEs in the framework of a therapeutic exposure to plausible virtual environments. All the commercially available GLEs detailed earlier were examined and a preliminary VE was built in order to compare each programs. The comparison of the GLEs\' characteristics narrowed down the possibilities and revealed that the Sandbox 2 Editor was the only program that exhibited all the critical features needed for the construction of therapeutic VEs. The nine VEs required for Study 2 were consequently created with this GLE.\r\n3. STUDY 2\r\n\r\n3.1. Objectives\r\n\r\nThe objectives were twofold. The first aim was to establish whether VEs constructed with the selected GLE can generate sufficient presence to immerse the subjects into the environment. A key to successful immersion and therapy is the sense of presence, which has been frequently defined as a transportation media: a sensation of being present in a virtual world ([16]). The second objective of the study was to demonstrate the ability of these VEs to induce anxiety or stress among the agoraphobics. A characteristic of significant importance for exposure therapy when taking into account the therapeutic model of anxiety disorders ([12]) where fear is represented as an information structure. It is suggested that this structure needs to be activated and accessed in order to modify it during the exposure process and achieve therapeutic efficiency. Therefore, the treatment success is highly dependent on the arousal reached in the confrontation ([25]).\r\n3.2. Methods\r\n\r\nSample\r\n\r\nThe sample comprised 18 subjects (11 women, seven men) meeting Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; [ 1]) criteria for a diagnosis of panic disorder with agoraphobia. Diagnoses were established by the first author based on a semistructured interview, the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV ([11]). The mean age of the sample was 44.11 years (SD = 13.79) ranging from 24 to 72 years old. Only four participants had previous video games experience. The mean duration of agoraphobia was 18 years (SD = 12.53). Exclusion criteria comprised epilepsy, dissociative or nondissociative chronic psychosis, recent discontinuation of psychotropic drugs, and substance dependence.\r\nAssessment Instruments\r\n\r\nPresence Questionnaire v3.0 (Witmer, Jerome & Singer, 2005)\r\n\r\nThe PQ consists of 32 items rated on a 7-point scale, assessing the factors leading to presence (the individual differences in terms of responses and the characteristics of the virtual environments or the systems responsible for the immersiveness). It contains five subscales: Realism, Affordance to Act, Interface Quality, Affordance to Examine, and Self-Evaluation of Performance.\r\nImmersive Tendencies Questionnaires (ITQ; Witmer & Singer, 1998)\r\n\r\nThe ITQ uses a 7-point Likert scale across 18 items to identify real-world behaviors and tendencies that may predict an individual\'s potential to experience presence in a nonexistent computerised world. It comprises four subscales: Focus, Involvement, Emotion, and Play.\r\nSubjective Unit of Discomfort (SUD; Wolpe, 1969)\r\n\r\nThis is a 100-point scale that measures the perceived level of anxiety at a given time.\r\nHeart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV)\r\n\r\nAn HR monitor (cf. apparatus for technical description) was used to measure HR in beats per minute. HRV was calculated. The HRV indicates the fluctuations of HR around an average HR. HR and HRV reflects the autonomic responses involved in emotional arousal, most notably during anxiety where the HR is expected to increase and the HRV to decrease ([ 2]). There is evidence that HR change is correlated with presence ([41]). Although self reports could be biased due to their inherent subjective nature, HR and HRV represent an alternative objective measurement of anxiety and presence.\r\nProcedure\r\n\r\nIn this second study, the highest rated GLE from Study 1 was used to create nine different VEs taking into account specific cues dreaded by agoraphobics. The environments comprised diverse anxiety-eliciting places and situations (a valley, lifts, supermarket, the Australian outback, subway stations, car parks, a cinema, flying on an airplane, and driving on a highway). Research with both humans ([31]) and animals ([14]) indicates that return of fear is less likely when exposure is conducted across a variety of environments ([24]). Given individual differences in the relevance of specific fears, a hierarchy of VEs from the least feared to the most feared VEs was established for each subject independently.\r\n\r\nPrior to immersion, participants completed the ITQ, and baseline HR/HRV was measured at rest across 5 min in a standing position. During the immersion process, participants were exposed to their personal least stressful environment first and then to their most stressful environment.\r\n\r\nThroughout the exposure, to measure the ability of the VE to generate stress, SUD scores and HR/HRV were recorded at rest (baseline), when the participants engaged with their least stressful VE and when they confronted their most feared virtual place. Immediately following each exposure, participants completed the PQ. Exposure sessions lasted for approximately 30 to 35 min, including a 5-min pause between immersive trials, in order to avoid cybersickness, following recommendations issued from previous work ([ 9]).\r\nApparatus\r\n\r\nThe VR system conforms to the \"affordable materials\" and portable constraints of the test. It includes a ruggedized Virtual Realities HMD 42 Pro Head-Mounted Display (HMD, 800 × 600 nonstereoscopic OLED screen) coupled with a 3 degrees of freedom head tracker embedded inside (angular resolution: 0,02°, latency 4 ms). As in video games and GLEs, navigation is triggered from mouse motion; the head tracker enables the subject to visually explore the environment (by updating the 3D scene as a function of head orientation) via the mouse emulation program provided with the head-mounted display. The subject\'s direction of locomotion is defined by his or her head orientation in the VEs. Participants had to use a wireless controller with a directional pad for the walking locomotion. The steering wheel exploited for the driving VE was a Logitech Momo with vibration and force feedback capabilities. The VEs were generated and ran on an ordinary notebook with an Intel I7 processor (4 cores), 4Go DDR2 RAM, an ATI M7740 graphic card with 1 Go RAM and a 1440 × 900 resolution screen. The software required is Microsoft Windows XP (32 or 64 bits edition), Microsoft DirectX 9.0 or higher, and the equipment\'s drivers.\r\n\r\nThe HR monitor is a Polar S810i. It included a transmitter and a wrist receiver. This monitor has proven to be as effective as an ECG for recording RR[ 1] intervals and HR measurements ([38]).\r\nVEs Created With Sandbox 2 Editor\r\n\r\nThe VEs represent the 3D computer-generated real-time worlds that participants explored using the VR equipment while being exposed to anxiogenic cues. The Sandbox 2 Level Editor\'s VEs reproduced realistic contemporary environments, which were selected according to recognized fear elicited places or situations for agoraphobics. These are places where escape may be hindered or help difficult to reach. For numerous situations may occur in the reality, nine different context and cues graded VEs were elaborated (a valley, a downtown and buildings with lifts of different sizes, a supermarket in a mall, the Australian outback at sunset, subways station with working trains, an underground car park, a cinema with a viewable movie, an airplane with all flying procedures, and highways/traffic jam with a drivable car [cf. screenshots supra]). All the VEs were constructed by a Ph.D. student in psychology and without the use of programming. The Ph.D. student had previous experience with level editing ([18]) and underwent 1 month of self-training using community forums and free tutorials available online. As a part of the learning process, 7 months were needed to build all the VEs. Additional time was required to use secondary applications in order to design and import objects that were not present in the objects database of the GLE such as the passenger airplane and cabin, subway, buildings, and so on.\r\n3.3. Results\r\n\r\nHRV was assessed by calculating a time domain variable entitled root mean square of successive differences, which is the square root of the mean squared difference of successive RR waves ([38]). The dependent variables SUD, HR, and HRV were compared across the three conditions: baseline, least feared VE, and most feared VE. Means, standard deviations, analysis of variance (ANOVA), F values, and statistic significance are presented in Table 2.\r\n\r\nConcerning the comparison of the dependent variable between the three conditions (baseline, least feared, and most feared VE), repeated measures ANOVA demonstrated a significant difference for SUD, F( 2, 16) = 89.93, p <.001, η2 =.92, as well as for HR, F( 2, 16) = 24.01, p <.001, η2 =.75, and HRV, F( 1, 17) = 10.83, p <.025, η2 =.57, with medium to large effect sizes for each. There was no significant difference between conditions on the PQ (cf. Table 2). Pairwise comparisons revealed that there was no significant difference between baseline and least feared VE for SUD, HR, and HRV. Pairwise comparison also indicated that there was a significant difference between VE conditions (least feared and most feared VE) for SUD as well as for HR and HRV.\r\n\r\nTABLE 2 Means, Standard Deviations of the Dependent Variables, and Results of a One-Way Analysis of Variance of Differences Between Baseline, Exposure to the Least Feared Virtual Environment, and Exposure to the Most Feared Virtual Environment\r\n\r\nTests	Baseline M (SD)	Least Feared VEM (SD)	Significance (Pairwise Comparison)	Most Feared VE M (SD)	Significance (Pairwise Comparison)	ANOVA F(2, 16) F(1, 17)	η2\r\nSUD	5.55 (5.66)	10 (7.47)	0.13, ns	45.83 (14.37)	0.001	89.93	0.92\r\nHR (bpm)	74.17 (8.05)	78.06 (7.81)	0.14, ns	94.90 (14.38)	0.001	24.01	0.75\r\nHRV (ms)	77.17 (37.37)	71.77 (43.06)	1.0, ns	37.08 (27.09)	0.005	10.83	0.57\r\nPQ		138.77		145.88		3.43, ns	0.168\r\nNote.

A stronger negative correlation of –0.365 (p <.14) was detected between the SUD and the HRV. Finally, the ITQ indicated the mean immersive tendencies of the sample and, although it was nonsignificant, it was positively correlated with the mean PQ (r =.33, p <.18).\r\n4. GENERAL DISCUSSION\r\n\r\nIn the first study of the present article, due to the variety of dreaded places exhibited in agoraphobia, this particular anxiety disorder was chosen to test VEs constructed with a GLE. The selection of the most relevant GLE was performed according to criteria reported in previous research ([10]; [16]; [21]; [32]; [33]; [34]; [35]; [44]). These criteria included powerful physics and graphics engine, realistic objects database, easy access for a sole designer (no programming knowledge needed) with large virtual space, avatars, and drivable vehicles. The criteria were applied to a variety of GLEs and the Sandbox 2 level editor was the only GLE to meet all criteria.\r\n\r\nDuring the second study, the VEs built with this GLE demonstrated their ability to generate significant levels of anxiety among agoraphobic participants across a variety of situations and to discriminate between least feared environments and most feared ones. This property was demonstrated through subjective as well as objective physiological measures. The ability to discriminate between least and most feared environments fulfils a necessary condition for a gradual therapeutic exposure of phobias.\r\n\r\nLevel of presence experienced by the participants was very satisfactory and far above the level detected during our previous work for the treatment of claustrophobia with another GLE ([18]). This indicates that the VE\'s immersiveness was excellent and that the subjects were very involved in the VEs built with Sandbox 2 regardless of their previous video game experience or age (with the oldest subject being 72 years old). All the subjects showed observable behavioral phenomenon while engaging with the virtual environments (e.g., leaning, grabbing objects, exclamation, talking to avatars, etc.), supporting the data based on subjective report. These observations suggest the potential value of an objective standard rating of presence based on overt behavior.\r\n\r\nPositive yet nonsignificant correlations were also demonstrated between the subjective and objective measures of anxiety. Similarly, nonsignificant positive correlations were found between presence and objective measures of anxiety. However, for these correlations have been nonsignificant, the results remain inconclusive. Should the sample have been larger, these results might have supported previous work on the synergistic relationship between presence and anxiety ([29]) and provide further support that participants were engaged with the VEs. Surprisingly, no relationship was found between subjective measure of anxiety and presence. This observation could be due to the small size of the sample or the inherent subjectivity bias of the SUD.\r\n\r\nOverall, the selected GLE was able to generate various realistic situations required for the treatment of agoraphobia and to elicit presence and anxiety during the trial, two key factors for an efficient virtual reality exposure therapy (VRET). These VEs were subsequently used for a therapeutic trial (Malbos, Rapee, & Kavakli, in press). The results of this trial indicated a positive effect on mood, an alleviation of the anxiety and a significant reduction in agoraphobia severity and avoidance behavior.\r\n\r\nPast studies pertaining to game and emotion studied the effect of measuring emotional states through physiological responses when playing video games ([13]; [15]; [20]). In this context of affective gaming, they proved that is was possible to detect accurately emotional states during playing sessions and adapt the difficulty or the anxiety-induced characteristics depending on these parameters. A major corollary to these outcomes is that future studies should explore the effects of adapting the difficulty of VEs during virtual-reality-based exposure therapy depending on the level of anxiety experienced by the phobics immersed in therapeutic VEs. Such real-time adaptation could enhance the required progressive curve in term of induced anxiety, a characteristic that holds clinical importance for therapeutic efficiency.\r\n\r\nFinally, the ability to build very distinct VEs, from walking in the Australian outback, to flying in an airplane and driving on the highway, can be exploited for clinical practice or psychological research involving the treatment of anxiety disorders at an affordable cost and with minimal personnel (one or two level designers or graphic artists or even a student in psychology self-trained in level design). Benefiting from powerful engine, compatibility with VR equipment, free tutorials, and constant update if popular, GLE\'s artificial world combined with VR offers a compelling concept: breaking the real and imaginary walls of a laboratory and offering more ecological environments for researchers, clinicians, and therapists.\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n\r\nWe thank Yao Ying, Andy Maesen (Sigma), Jonathan Gaston, Eric Fassbender, Debbie Richards, Iwan Kartiko, Vickie Williams, John Porte, Meredith Taylor, Psyfalc, Dan Dombrowski, Carl Kenner, and Racer as well as the reviewers for their help and advices.\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n1 American Psychiatric Association. 2000.

A. Gray’s (1975) theory distinguishes between two motivational systems, which he refers to as the behavioral activation system (BAS) and the behavioral inhibition system (BIS). D. C. Fowles (1980) has shown that heart rate responses reflect activity of the BAS, and electrodermal responses reflect activity of the BIS. Both BAS and BIS are reliably activated during in-vivo exposure to fearful situations (F. H. Wilhelm & W. T. Roth, 1998). However, due to the constraints imposed by virtual reality (VR), we hypothesized that VR exposure to fearful situations would activate the BIS alone. To test this hypothesis, a VR free-standing elevator simulation was presented to participants selected for high and low fear of heights. As predicted, the high-anxious group strongly responded electrodermally (effect size d = 1.53), but showed only minimal HR elevations during exposure ( d = 0.12), and little other cardiovascular or respiratory changes. The low-anxious control group showed little electrodermal and HR reactivity ( d = 0.28 and 0.12). A comparison with data from a previous study demonstrated that this pattern was in stark contrast to the large electrodermal and cardiovascular response observed during situational in-vivo exposure outside the laboratory. We conclude that the BIS, but not BAS, is selectively activated during VR exposure, causing discordance between self-report and commonly used physiological measures of anxiety. Results are discussed within the framework of E. B. Foa & M. J. Kozak’s (1986) emotional processing theory of fear modification, suggesting different mechanisms underlying VR and in-vivo exposure treatments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

Interpersonal distance is an important nonverbal behavior, and is used to regulate personal space in a complex interplay with other nonverbal behaviors such as eye gaze. In social anxiety, studies regarding the impact of interpersonal distance on within-situation avoidance behavior are so far rare. Thus the present study aimed to scrutinize the relationship between gaze direction, sex, interpersonal distance, and social anxiety in social interactions. Social interactions were modeled in a virtual-reality (VR) environment, where 20 low and 19 high socially anxious women were confronted with approaching male and female characters, who stopped in front of the participant, either some distance away or close to them, and displayed either a direct or an averted gaze. Gaze and head movements, as well as heart rate, were measured as indices of avoidance behavior and fear reactions. High socially anxious participants showed a complex pattern of avoidance behavior: when the avatar was standing farther away, high socially anxious women avoided gaze contact with male avatars showing a direct gaze. Furthermore, they showed avoidance behavior (backward head movements) in response to male avatars showing a direct gaze, regardless of the interpersonal distance. Overall, the current study proved that VR social interactions might be a very useful tool for investigating avoidance behavior of socially anxious individuals in highly controlled situations. This might also be the first step in using VR social interactions in clinical protocols for the therapy of social anxiety disorder. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]'),

The concept of neuromatrix suggests that pain is an amalgam of affect, cognition, and sensation mediated through diverse brain regions. Moreover, the experience of pain appears to be reduced by environmental stimuli that drive attention away from the noxious events. Accordingly, immersion in a computer-generated, three-dimensional virtual environment has been used as an efficient distraction tool in a number of studies on pain management. However, no systematic approaches have explored the psychological factors that influence the effectiveness of virtual reality (VR) as a distraction technology. This review aims to outline the fundamental psychological factors involved in the use of VR to provide pain management. An analysis of the literature revealed some important elements associated with the patients\' subjective experience. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The results suggest the importance of different psychological factors in the effectiveness of the analgesic distraction. While sense of presence influence the effectiveness of VR as a distraction tool, anxiety as well as positive emotions directly affect the experience of pain. Future challenges for pain management via VR include adopting properly validated measures to assess psychological factors and using different experimental conditions to better understand their complex effects.

We built a website of a hotel and used VR functions to show the exterior, the lobby, a guest room, and a restaurant through an interactive and spatial shot of the hotel images. The experiment was conducted with a premise that the subjects were about to embark on a journey to an unknown place and to stay at an unknown hotel whose website contained VR functions. The subjects were asked to play with VR functions of the hotel website and then to complete a survey with questions regarding the degree of anxiety on the travel and psychological relief that might have been perceived by the subjects.

The use of the HMD hel-met allows users to perceive a 3D stereoscopic images and to determine the spatial position in the visual environment via motion tracking sen-sors in the helmet. Meanwhile, users can hear sounds from headphones and interact with vir-tual  objects  using  input  devices  like  joysticks,  wands, and data gloves. As a result, users feel as  though  they  can  look  around  and  move  through the simulated environment [2]. Because of these characteristics, over the past decade  the  application  of  VR  technology  has  expanded from entertainment industry to clini-cal  medicine.  Researchers  and  doctors  have  explored the effects of VR simulation on physi-cal  rehabilitation,  pain  management,  surgery  training,  anatomical  education  and  treatment  of psychiatric disorders [1, 3-7]. Compared with traditional methods, VR technology is regarded as  a  cost-effective  and  efficient  tool  in  the aforementioned areas.Although VR devices have similar structure, the discrepancies in hardware and software requi- rements often arise due to different application fields.  In  addition,  different  researchers  em-phasize different models of research utilization. For example, VR simulators for education focus on the 3D environment and network resources [8]. VR simulators for surgical training focus on the  interaction  with  operation  devices  and  vir-tual anatomical structure [9, 10]. VR simulators for  psychological  disorders  focus  on  the  emo-tion  control  and  feedback.  The  main  objective  of this paper is to discuss the application of VR technology in clinical medicine. The three app- roaches  addressed  in  this  paper  have  been  research  hotspots  for  over  two  decades,  and  thus far they have been subject of many stud-ies.  By  summarizing  the  current  research  re- sults, we analyze the advantages of VR technol-ogy  for  each  field,  and  make  predictions  for future utilizations. VR technology for surgery trainingFor decades, the acquisition of technical skills in the operating room under the supervision of senior  surgeons  has  been  the  only  way  for  junior  doctors  to  receive  surgical  training  [11].  As  the  number  of  trainees  has  increased,  the  opportunities  to  acquire  necessary  technical  skills  have  become  increasingly  limited  due  to  the higher costs, ethical concerns, and decreas-ing resident work hours. A reduction in training hours  has  been  caused  by  introduction  of  the  European  Working  Time  Directive  (EWTD)  ac- ross  Europe,  and  the  80  hours  per  week  limit  introduced by the Accreditation Council for Gra-duate Medical Education (ACGME) [12, 13]. The real and immediate consequence of these poli-cies  was  a  continuous  reduction  in  ‘hands-on’  experience  and  independent  surgical  experi-ence for trainees [14]. Furthermore, as the sur-gical  techniques  have  advanced  and  evolved,  sole observation was no longer enough for ac- quiring certain skills and special techniques. In these  circumstances,  VR  training  has  become  an  essential  prerequisite  for  junior  doctors  before  they  are  allowed  to  actively  participate  in real operations.Compared   with   animal   modes,   videos   and   e-learning,  VR  simulations  are  more  realistic  due to very intuitive anatomic structures exhib-ited in the 3D graphics (Table 1). Trainees can interact   with   all   the   anatomical   structures,  including skin, muscle, bone, nerve, and blood vessel. Changes that occur following each sur-gical step are very much the same as in reality. Whole  performance  can  be  recorded,  com-pared and analyzed, making data permanently available  for  trainees  [11].  From  different  per-spective,  senior  supervision  and  patient  par- ticipation are no longer needed during the peri-od of basic skill training and acquisition, since the  VR  simulations  can  provide  a  controlled  virtual environment necessary to satisfy these requirements  outside  the  operating  room  [6].  Multiple  aspects  of  a  trainee’s  psychomotor performance skills can be directly measured by the objective performance assessment offered by simulations. The training effect of VR simu- lations  are  generally  evaluated  by  standard  parameters,  including  time  necessary  to  com-plete  task,  path  length,  number  of  collisions,  injuries, number of anatomic landmarks identi-fied, number of loose bodies found, satisfac-tion and so on.Laparoscopic  To safely and effectively complete laparoscopic operation,  surgeons  must  face  a  long  learning  curve and extensive training. However, it is not possible for surgical trainees to practice basic surgical  and  laparoscopic  skills  in  the  operat- ing  room,  since  this  would  expose  patients  to  potential risks [5]. Due to these circumstances, VR  simulators  are  widely  used  in  laparoscopic  training   institutes,   since   as   already   stated,   acquiring specific surgical skills in the operat-ing room can be inefficient, time consuming, and potentially risky for the patients [6]. LapSim (Surgical Science, Sweden), Lap Mentor (3D System, USA), MIST-VR (minimally invasive surgical  trainer-virtual  reality,  Mentice  AB, Sweden),  Simendo  (Simendo,  Holland)  are  the  four  common  VR  simulators  in  laparoscopic  training  [5,  15-19].  MIST-VR,  the  earliest  VR simulator,  was  presented  by  researchers  from  Manchester  Royal  Infirmary  and  Virtual  Pre-sence in 1997 (Figures 1A, 2A). The initial sys-tem  consisted  of  a  200  MHz  Pentium PC with a 32 Mb RAM linked to a jig that con-tained two standard laparoscopic instruments. Trainees had the possibility to simulate some of the  manoeuvers  performed  during  a  laparos-copy by “grasping” and “manipulating”. Besides, it was possible to record, compare, and analyze individual task performance [20]. This was the prototype  of  modern  VR  simulators.  LapSim  and Lap Mentor, that appeared around 2002, have shown to be the most frequently used VR simulators (Figures 1B, 1C, 2B, 2C). Both com-prise  an  operating  platform,  cameras  and  a  monitor,  and  both  of  them  provide  basic  skills  training  and  procedural  training.  Trainees  can  practice  their  manipulation  and  surgical  tech-niques  through  nonanatomic  settings  and  vir-tual  patients.  Competence  level  of  trainees  could be assessed by a large number of quali-tative and comprehensive performance param-eters [21, 22]. Simendo, that appeared the lat-est  among  VR  simulators  mentioned  above,  has smaller application range (Figures 1D, 2D). It was initially designed to simulate the endos-copy  and  the  training  mode  was  similar  to  LapSim and Lap Mentor [23, 24]. Task comple-tion time and surgical skills have been shown to improve following training with all four kinds of VR simulators [5]. Interestingly, none of the four simulators incorporated HMD helmet as graph-ic output device in any of the available versions, including  the  latest.  This  could  be  because  operations  in  real  laparoscopic  surgery,  like  camera  manipulation,  hand-eye  coordination  and bimanual maneuvering, are accomplished by observing the monitor. According to the lat-est  research  in  2017,  combination  of  LapSim  with HMD helmet led to high levels of immer-sion, but there was no significant difference in the training effect [9].Orthopedics Compared  with  laparoscopic  and  other  surgi- cal disciplines, development and application of the  simulators  for  orthopedic  surgery  are  lag-ging  behind,  which  is  evidenced  by  a  small  number of studies that have attempted to cre-ate  or  validate  orthopedic  surgery  simulators  over the past two decades [25]. Among a very small number of available papers, research on VR   simulators   for   arthroscopy   stands   out.   Procedicus   KSA   VR   surgical   simulator,   Pro- cedicus virtual arthroscopy simulator (Mentice AB,  Sweden),  and  Insight  Arthro  VR  Shoulder  Simulator   (3D   Systems,   USA)   are   generally   used for arthroscopy training [11]. Procedicus  KSA  VR  simulator  and  Procedicus  virtual  arthroscopy  (VA)  simulator  were  devel-oped  by  the  same  company  and  have  been  employed  to  train  novices  since  2002  and  2003.  Procedicus  KSA  simulator  is  a  kind  of  endoscopic   simulator   with   haptic   feedback   and  anatomical  graphics.  Procedicus  VA  simu-lator was the first specific visual-spatial simula-tor  used  for  knee  arthroscopy  training  (Figure 3A  and  3B).  Besides  platform,  cameras,  optic  device, and probe, it also has haptic feedback. Trainees are instructed to complete tasks on a virtual knee, while the haptic feedback occurs every time an organ is touched. However, there was  no  evidence  to  prove  that  performance  would  improve  following  short  time  training  on the  simulator  [26-29].  Insight  Arthro  VR  Sh- oulder  Simulator  uses  a  life-size  plastic  shoul-der  with  predefined  portals  (Figure  3C).  The  input  devices  consist  of  two  robotic  arms  that  send haptic feedback to the user. This simula-tor  can  create  different  positions,  like  beach-chair or lateral decubitus that help young physi-cians  develop  necessary  skills.  In  addition,  trainees  can  choose  nonanatomic  tasks  for  training  of  basic  visuospatial  coordination  or  anatomic  tasks  for  procedural  skills  training.  This  VR  simulator  has  been  regarded  as  an  effective tool for both resident experience and shoulder arthroscopic experience [30, 31]. Besides  these  three  VR  simulators,  a  group  of  Japanese  researchers  has  assembled  a  VR  simulator  with  an  electromagnetic  motion  tra- cking   system,   Aurora   measurement   system   (Northern  Digital,  Canada)  and  an  artificial knee  model  (Pacific  Research  Laboratories, WA). A six degrees of freedom sensor was fixed beneath the knee model to detect surgical for- ces loaded on the joint and to provide the data on set of forces as well as torques. This simula-tor  can  make  quantitative  assessment  of  ar- throscopic skills [32]. VR simulators for open surgery, including total hip replacement (THA), hip trauma and fracture fixation,  have  also  been  investigated  by  re-searchers  [25].  Most  VR  simulators  placed emphasis  on  preoperative  planning  and  navi- gation  in  vivo.  A  simulator  named  HipNav  was  developed for THA training at Carnegie Mellon by Digioia et al. It contained kinematic hip joint models  and  tools  for  predicting  femoral  range  of motion, bone motion, and optimal alignment based  on  implant  placement.  It  could  aid  sur-geons in determining optimal, patient specific acetabular implant preoperatively and in trans-ferring it to surgical navigation in-vivo [33, 34]. The  TraumaVision  fractured  femur  orthopedic  simulator  (Swemac  Orthopaedics,  Sweden)  is  once-famous  VR  simulator  with  haptic  feed-back  that  aimed  to  recreate  the  sensation  of  drilling and reaming of cortical and cancellous bones  (Figure  4).  It  is  controlled  via  stylus,  which  serves  as  navigator  on  the  computer  screen. The haptic feedback provided by Ge-omagic Touch X (Geomagic, USA) device allows users  to  feel  realistic  resistance  when  in  con-tact  with  soft  tissue  and  bone  (Figure  5).  The  sensitivity of the haptic device can even gener-ate tactile differentiation between cortical and cancellous bone [35-37]. Jun et el have devel-oped  a  system  to  simulate  total  knee  replace-ment (TKR) surgery based on 3D knee models reconstructed from computed tomography (CT) scans.  The  system  guides  surgeons  to  fully  comprehend  the  patient’s  3D  anatomy  and  to  interactively determine custom implant compo-nents  by  extracting  knee  anatomical  parame-ters  from  3D  triangular  models.  A  virtual  sur-gery  based  on  a  preoperative  3D  simulation  can be used to obtain surgical parameters for resecting femoral and tibial models. The virtual implants are individually attached to the distal femur  and  to  the  proximal  tibia  following  the  resection.  The  axial  reference  of  implant  com-ponents is aligned with mechanical axis of the femur and tibia bone [38]. Other surgerySteven  et  al  have  reported  an  application  of  VR  simulator  in  mastoidectomy  performance  assessment [39]. They have chosen Visible Ear Simulator  (VES),  a  fully  functional  3D  virtual  temporal  bone  simulator  with  force  feedback,  to  complete  this  task.  Participants  have  per-formed a complete mastoidectomy by entering the  antrum  through  a  virtual  temporal  bone,  and the results have showed successful acqui-sition of basic competencies.EYESI, produced by VRMagic, is currently the only VR surgical training system for ophthalmic surgery available on the market. It is a monitor-based simulator with modular that allows for a breadth of ophthalmic surgical procedures, like vitreoretinal surgery and capsulorhexis [40]. Advantages and limitations  As  an  upcoming  tool  in  surgery  training  pro-grams,  VR  simulators  focus  on  the  advanced  stages of training. They can provide automated scoring  with  numerous  objective  metrics,  that  are very promising alternative for the laborious and  subjective  ratings  usually  performed  by  experts  during  live  or  videotaped  procedures  [41-43]. Compared with VR simulation, trainees that have received conventional surgical train-ing  have  been  found  to  perform  surgery  sub-stantially slower and to be more likely to cause injury,  damage  tissue  or  fail  to  progress  with  the surgery [44]. The immersive experience cre-ated   by   VR   simulation   provides   enhanced   understanding  of  complex  3D  body  structures  and  handling  of  instruments  for  trainees  in  a  controlled, risk free environment. Meanwhile, haptic  experience  in  surgical  simulation  can  help  trainees  to  familiarize  themselves  with  operation  process  and  to  develop  their  opera-tive  and  decision-making  skills  without  poten-tial  harm  to  patients  [45,  46].  However,  the  accuracy and efficacy of VR training still need to be improved. Density, palpable properties and convex  surfaces  are  very  challenging  to  simu-late  in  a  virtual  environment.  Moreover,  the response  rate  and  intensity  feedback  of  com-mercial haptic devices are too weak to correctly emulate vibration while drilling [47].An ideal VR simulator for surgical skills training must satisfy several conditions, including multi-modal training plans, artificial platform, accu-rate  haptic  feedback,  immersive  visual  and  audio technologies, sensitive input devices, as well as appropriate software with real time sim-ulation and assessment criteria. In addition, it should incorporate data from MRI or CT to pro-vide patient-specific simulations. Combination of  physical  body  models  and  actual  surgical  tools with VR simulators promotes the interac-tion between realistic tools, virtual bodily fluids and  virtual  physical  materials.  Abnormal  and  patient-specific  cases  can  be  modelled  and assessed in VR simulators for trainees to prac-tice and to prepare in vivo. These features and limitations may provide some directions for the future development of VR technology for surgi-cal skills training [25]. VR technology for pain managementPain,  that  is  acute,  intermittent,  or  chronic  in  nature, is the most universal medical complaint among  hospitalized  patients.  To  enhance  pain  management, physical and psychosocial treat-ments  must  occur  simultaneously.  However,  since pain has different causes, it is difficult to  establish  standards  for  when  and  how  to  change  pain  therapy  and  how  to  deliver  the  same [48]. VR technology has been firstly pro-posed as a tool for pain modulation by Hoffman et al in 1998. This new treatment has shown to be  effective  in  reduction  of  burn-induced  pain  and  management  of  pain  in  other  situations  [49-52]. VR for acute pain managementAcute  pain  caused  by  operation  or  trauma  in- duces  a  wide  range  of  pathophysiological  res- ponses.  Inflammatory,  physiological  and  sub-sequent  behavioral  responses  follow  the  acti-vation of nociceptors through tissue injury. Sym- pathoneural   and   neuroendocrine   activation,   combined with uncontrolled pain, can ultimate-ly  lead  to  various  detrimental  responses  [53].  The  management  of  pain  in  the  acute  care  setting  often  relies  on  pharmacological  treat-ments,  such  as  anesthetic  and  analgesic  ag- ents,  to  attenuate  these  pathophysiological  responses [54]. However,  the  arrival  of  VR  technology  brought  another  path  for  the  management  of  acute  pain.  Debashish  et  al  have  investigated  the  effect  of  VR  based  games  in  management  of  burn-induced injuries. In their research, the VR equipment used to enable interaction with the virtual  environment  included  a  laptop  (Dell,  USA) with game software, a HMD (IOGlassess HMD with SVGA video resolution of 800x600 16  million  colors),  and  a  tracking  system  (In- tersense, USA). This randomized controlled trial study  has  proved  that  VR  technology  provided  analgesia  with  minimal  side  effects  and  very  little  impact  on  the  physical  hospital  environ-ment  [55].  In  addition,  several  other  studies  have confirmed that standard analgesia cou-pled with VR based games is effective in reduc-ing acute pain [52, 56, 57]. The composition of VR  equipment  was  like  Debashish’s  design,  including computer, HMD, game software, he-adphone and input device.  Another  cutting-edge  approach  for  use  of  VR  technology in pain management refers to aug-menting hypnosis, also known as virtual reality hypnosis (VRH). According to Patterson, no spe-cial hardware, besides VR equipment is neces-sary.  The  most  interesting  point  in  his  study  was  the  application  of  Vega  VR-world-building  software  (MultiGen-Paradigm,  Canada).  Parti-cipants “glided” through an icy 3D virtual can-yon  following  a  predetermined  path  and  shot  virtual  snowballs  at  virtual  snowmen,  igloos,  robots,  and  penguins.  Sound  effects  and  ani-mated  colors  were  simultaneously  incorporat-ed in VR condition [58]. The patients reported lower levels of pain and anxiety under this con-dition. In a study published in 2009, based on hypnotherapy  theory  researchers  have  devel-oped a VR sequence to replace distraction type programs. The use of VR for relaxation, in addi-tion to use of morphine for pain reduction have shown to be very effective [59]. VR for chronic pain managementChronic pain is typically defined as pain lasting longer  than  three  months,  or  beyond  the  ex- pected period of healing [60]. Chronic pain con-ditions  are  difficult  to  treat  because  of  non-effective traditional pharmacologic treatments and invasive nerve blocks. Recent advantages in functional imaging technology have revealed that chronic pain conditions are caused by neu-ronal  plasticity  in  the  central  nervous  system  (CNS),  even  though  the  underlying  pathogene-sis  has  not  been  fully  understood  [61].  Only  a  few studies have investigated the use of VR for chronic pain management, therefore very little is  known  about  the  use  of  VR  for  chronic  pain  treatment and for long-term pain rehabilitation [1]. Sato  et  al  have  developed  an  advanced  VR  based mirror visual feedback system and have used  it  to  treat  complex  regional  pain  syn-drome.   The   non-immersive   computer-based   desktop VR system includes a computer, a real-time  position  and  motion  tracker  (Polhems,  USA),  a  CyberGlove  (Immersion,  USA)  that serves  as  a  hand  input  device,  and  a  monitor.  A  virtual  environment  was  developed  using  Autodesk 3DS Max (San Rafael, USA), where the  exercises  are  target-oriented  motor  con-trolled tasks via various movements like reach-ing  out,  grasping,  transferring,  and  placing.  Their  study  has  demonstrated  that  VR  system  might increase analgesic efficacy and provide a  promising  alternative  treatment  for  complex  regional pain [62]. Besides, the effect of track-er-based VR system on chronic neck pain treat-ment has been investigated. Participants were asked “spray” flies that randomly appeared in the virtual environment provided by the HMD. Researchers  have  assessed  cervical  range  of  motion,  which  has  shown  to  be  significantly related  with  pathophysiology  of  chronic  neck  pain [63]. Advantages and future perspectiveThe  most  powerful  analgesics  cannot  control  pain  in  every  patient,  although  opioid  analge-sics  (e.g.,  morphine  and  its  derivatives)  have  proven  to  be  quite  effective  in  providing  pain  relief [64]. VR technology and hypnosis are two potential  alternatives  to  pharmacologic  treat-ments  of  pain.  The  use  of  VR  technology  that  enhances  distraction  has  shown  to  be  rela- tively  effective  method  for  pain  management  (Figure  6).  VR  can  affect  pain  perception  th- rough immersive virtual environment, by occu-pying finite attentional resources and by block-ing  external  stimulation  associated  with  real  environment  and  the  painful  stimuli  [65].  Sin- ce distraction interventions work by competing for  attention  otherwise  directed  towards  pain-ful  stimuli,  pain  tolerance  and  pain  threshold  have  shown  to  increase  under  VR  conditions  [66, 67]. Moreover, pain intensity, anxiety and time  spent  thinking  about  pain  have  shown  to  decrease following VR distraction [67]. Immersive VR technology is more likely to gen-erate relief from pain compared to non-immer-sive  VR  technology  [68].  Pain  relief  effect  has  shown  to  be  correlated  with  technological  ad- vancement  of  instruments  used  to  generate  VR; the greater sense of presence in the virtual world  created  by  high-tech  equipment  that  in- corporate  an  active  cognitive  processing  com-ponent  are  more  effective  in  alleviating  pain  [69,  70].  Pain  signaling  in  key  pain  matrix  re- gions  could  be  inhibited  via  VR  technology.  As  the price of VR equipment keeps lowering, this approach  is  becoming  increasingly  affordable  and  could  potentially  turn  into  self-manage-ment  tool  for  pain  relief  used  by  patients  in  and/or  out  of  hospital.  For  example,  a  simple  Sony  PlayStation  with  a  VR  HMD  could  be employed to treat pain [67]. Although research results  support  the  premise  that  VR  devices  can  reduce  pain,  the  neurobiological  mecha-nisms still need to be determined. The current state  of  VR  as  a  tool  for  pain  management  is  still  in  its  early  developmental  stages  and  it  requires  numerous  applications  for  patients  with an array of acute and chronic medical con-ditions.  Nonetheless,  VR  technology  will  even-tually emerge as a promising first-line interven-tion  and  complementary  therapy  for  patients  with pain [1].VR technology for psychological diseases therapy The  treatments  for  many  psychological  disor-ders commonly require patients to confront the situations they fear. This kind of approach, also known  as  exposure  therapy,  helps  patients  to  accept their anxious emotions and consequent-ly  change  their  beliefs  about  the  likelihood  or  catastrophic  nature  of  feared  consequences.  Exposure  therapy  is  very  effective  but  hard  to  execute,   since   complex   conditions   such   as   social situations, thunder, injury and other pho-bic  stimuli  are  potentially  very  challenging  to  recreate and to expose individuals to the same in a real life setting [71]. Consequently, virtual environment created by VR simulators could be a valuable option for exposure therapy [72]. According  to  the  latest  randomized  controlled  trial for social anxiety, in vitro exposure through VR  has  shown  to  be  superior  compared  to  in  vivo   exposure,   based   on   self-reported   out-comes   registered   six   months   following   the   treatment [73]. Dana et al have designed virtu-al  environments  for  phobia  treatment.  They  have  searched  the  methods  for  creating  and  combining  virtual  objects,  environments  and  situations  for  therapy  (Figure  7A).  HMD  and data  glove  have  been  required  for  immersion  and active participation in the virtual world [74]. A  group  of  researchers  from  Spain  have  used  VR  system  to  enhance  emotional  skills  in  chil-dren  with  autism  spectrum  disorders  (Figure 7B  and  7C).  The  system  contained  L-shaped  screens, which allowed the child to observe the environment  from  the  frontal  view  and  to  act  from below. Mood and pose of the child were determined by a robot with an eye-in-hand sys-tem.  The  avatars  in  the  virtual  world  and  their  moods  were  design  via  3DS  Max.  The  child could interact with different avatars and could carry out a series of emotion recognition tasks, thus practicing the emotional responses [75]. Advantages and directionsVirtual  reality  exposure  therapy  and  virtual  re- ality  cognitive  behavior  therapy  have  become  effective  choices  for  patients  with  anxiety  dis-orders  and  other  phobias  like  fear  of  flying, claustrophobia,  acrophobia  or  generalized  so- cial phobia [76-79]. Instead of being exposed to the real world, patients can experience an anx-iety-provoking  scenario  in  the  realistic  virtual  environment  generated  by  VR  technology.  Pa- tients  and  therapists  can  both  benefit  from this kind of treatment, especially in view of ad- vanced  VR  technology  that  is  becoming  ever  more available [80]. Furthermore, VR technolo-gy  can  be  used  as  self-treatment  to  some  extent [81]. VR devices can be used in private practices  and  even  private  homes,  which  is  very  important  since  it  may  additional  aid  pa- tients to cope with unwanted feelings in “emo-tionally safe environments” [1].According  to  existing  publications,  the  soft- ware  is  the  core  part  affecting  the  treatment  outcomes.  Virtual  models  and  environments designed for medical therapies vary according to patient’s specific symptoms. The simultane-ous use of panoramic photos, videos and mod-els  controlled  by  the  therapist  may  be  helpful,  since  the  number  and  category  of  models  as  well  as  the  interaction  methods  with  virtual  objects  can  be  adapted  according  to  thera- peutic  progress.  Moreover,  measuring  princi-ples  are  vital  software  component.  Every  pa- tient’s symptom is different, each VR platform has  diverse  working  conditions  and  therapy  procedures largely depend on individual thera-pist’s decisions. An appropriate evaluation sys-tem  for  VR  therapy  alone,  or  for  VR  therapy  combined  with  other  therapeutic  methods  are  urgently  needed.  Treatment  of  psychological  diseases  is  very  time  consuming,  thus  VR  de- vices   providing   plentiful   and   vivid   contents   may  be  of  great  help  for  patients  going  throu- gh difficult periods.Conclusion Virtual  reality  technology  is  widely  applied  in  the field of medicine. Huge benefits have been reported following its use for rehabilitation, dis-ability  management,  surgical  training,  psycho-logical diseases therapy and analgesic modali-ty [3, 28, 36, 62, 76, 82]. This review presented current virtual reality based simulators for med-ical  application,  especially  in  surgery  training,  pain  management  and  therapy  for  psychologi-cal diseases. A comparison between operation methods  and  existing  simulator  features  and  relative  results  was  provided  to  demonstrate  the status quo as well as recent developments. In  addition,  new  directions  in  VR  technology  research  and  clinical  significance  were  ad-dressed by evaluating existing literature on the efficacy of VR simulators.AcknowledgementsThis   study   was   funded   by   the   Projects   of   International  Cooperation  and  Exchanges  NS- FC  (81420108021,  to  Q.J.),  National  Key  Te- chnology Support Program (2015BAI08B02, to Q.J.),   Excellent   Young   Scholars   NSFC   (816- 22033,  to  D.S.)  and  Open  Program  of  Jiangsu  Key  Laboratory  of  3D  Printing  Equipment  and  Manufacturing  (3D  L201601,  to  L.L.).

Eight researchers feigned auditory hallucinations, which led to admission with a psychiatric diagnosis in 12 hospitals in the USA. Nowadays, this study is often quoted to criticize  the  objectivity  and  reliability  of  the  diagnostic  process  in  psychiatry. Medical specialists in the somatic field can usually rely on numerous biological markers, such as blood tests and imaging techniques, to confirm and classify the suspected diagnosis. Up till now, such biological markers are lacking in psychiatry. A psychiatric diagnosis is still largely based on a clinical interview, a mental state examination, and multiple questionnaires (2, 3). This imposes the risk of recall bias, since important diagnostic information is depend-ent  upon  the  memory  and  current  state  of  mind  of  the  particular  patient.  Furthermore,  there  is  a  risk  for  interviewer  bias  since  the  conclusion on both the diagnosis and the severity of the diagnosed disorder is dependent on the interpretation of the clinician. To sup-port the objectivity and reliability of a psychiatric diagnosis, there is a clear need for new assessment methods. Objective and reliable assessment methods would also contribute to standardization and uniformity for research purposes.With  increasing  technological  innovation,  it  is  important  to  consider  virtual  reality  (VR)  for  this  purpose.  VR  is  defined  as  a  computer  generated  environment  using  sensory  stimuli  in  which  a  person  can  explore  and  interact  (4).  The  environment  can  be  displayed  on  a  general  computer  screen,  a  head-mounted  display  (HMD),  or  a  surround  system.  VR  environments  are  generally  designed to resemble real life situations and can be extended with specific  stimuli  to  provoke  symptoms,  like  disorder-related  items  and  virtual  humans,  which  are  also  known  as  avatars  (5).  These  VR environments, therefore, provide the opportunity to study par-ticipants in a lifelike, yet standardized and controlled environment. VR environments are increasingly used in psychiatric therapeutic settings to facilitate virtual exposure in behavioral therapy (6, 7). In this setting, the virtual environment is designed to provoke psychi-atric symptoms like fear and stress, after which gradual extinction can follow. If a VR environment is able to provoke and simultane-ously  measure  psychiatric  symptoms,  it  can  be  used  to  improve  reliability and objectivity in the assessment of psychiatric disorders. The  first  objective  of  this  literature  review  is  to  investigate  if  VR  environments are capable of simultaneously provoking and meas-uring psychiatric symptoms, thereby showing a relevant difference in outcome measures between patients with a psychiatric disorder and  healthy  controls.  The  second  objective  is  to  identify  correla-tions  between  VR  outcome  measures  and  traditional  diagnostic  measures including clinician or patient-rated questionnaires.MeTHODSWe searched the databases PubMed, Embase, and Psycinfo from January 1990 until May 2016. We used a combination of the key-words (diagnos*, assess*, or test) and (psychiatry or psychiatric) and VR. This search revealed 360 studies on PubMed. The same keywords  revealed  an  additional  two  articles  in  Embase  and  Psycinfo.  Additional  searches  on  multiple  psychiatric  disorders  combined  with  the  terms  VR  AND  diagnos*  or  assess*  were  also performed. The studies were screened for title and abstract when the title was suitable. After review, 39 relevant studies were identified. References of these studies and related citations were searched to identify eligible articles not located through the initial search of the electronic databases.Studies  were  included  if  they  concerned  a  VR  environment  used  in  the  assessment  of  a  psychiatric  disorder  and  made  a  comparison between a clinical and healthy control sample. We also included studies restricted to a clinical sample investigating a  correlation  between  VR  outcome  measures  and  traditional  diagnostic   measures.   We   included   only   English   language   publications.  Studies  were  excluded  if  they  concerned  a  VR  environment  used  for  therapeutic  purposes,  restriction  to  a  non-clinical  sample,  investigation  of  another  technology  than  VR  (e.g.,  telephone,  internet,  online  modules,  videoconferenc-ing, mobile technology, social media), and studies restricted to feasibility  testing.  Furthermore,  studies  were  excluded  if  they  concerned a computerized version of a neuropsychological test.ReSULTSPsychosis and SchizophreniaTo  date,  15  studies  have  investigated  VR  environments  in  the  assessment  of  a  psychotic  population.  Additionally,  one  review  of  the  implementation  of  VR  in  the  assessment  and  treatment  of  psychotic  disorders  was  found  (8).  The  VR  environments  measure  a  certain  aspect  of  psychosis,  such  as  paranoia,  social  behavior, and cognitive disabilities.ParanoiaUsing VR, paranoid ideations in reaction to avatars with a neutral facial  ex<x>pression  can  be  assessed  in  a  standardized  environment.  This  was  tested  in  patients  with  a  psychotic  disorder  in  a  virtual  underground tube (9, 10), a virtual café, and shopping street (11). In all these studies, paranoid ideations toward the neutral avatars were determined after exposure to the VR environment by scales specifically  developed  for  this  purpose,  such  as  the  State  Social  Paranoia  Scale  (12)  and  the  Virtual  Reality  Questionnaire  (13). The Green et al. Paranoid Thoughts Scale (14) was obtained prior to  exposure  to  the  VR  environments  and  used  as  the  traditional  measure.   Freeman   et   al.   found   significantly   more   paranoid   ideations  attributed  to  the  neutral  avatars  in  the  patient  group  compared to healthy controls (9). This was in contrast to Fornells-Ambrojo et al. who found no difference between the patient and healthy control groups. However, in the patient group, they found a positive correlation (r= 0.62, p= 0.004) between paranoid idea-tion in VR and paranoid ideations in real life (10). Valmaggia et al. also found a positive correlation between rated paranoid thoughts attributed  to  the  avatars  and  paranoid  thoughts  experienced  in  real life (r= 0.61, p= 0.004) in patients classified as “at risk” for psychosis (15). Furthermore, Veling et al. also found a strong cor-relation  between  paranoid  ideations  in  VR  and  baseline  levels  of  paranoia (r= 0.67, p< 0.01) (11).Social BehaviorInterestingly,  the  assessment  of  social  behavior  in  schizophrenia  patients  is  possible  through  the  interaction  with  avatars  in  VR.  Dyck et al. showed that schizophrenia patients had more difficul-ties  recognizing  displayed  emotions  on  avatar  faces  compared  to  healthy controls (16). Kim et al. found lower scores on interpreting avatar emotions, verbal cues, and gestures in patients compared to healthy controls (17). In patients, they found a negative correlation between  emotion  recognition  and  positive  symptoms  (r=−0.49, p= 0.01) and negative symptoms (r=−0.36, p= 0.05) as assessed on the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) (18). In other studies,  patients  showed  less  gazing  toward  an  avatar  during  the  listening phase of a negative conversation (19), and kept a larger dis-tance toward an avatar compared to healthy controls. Patients with more  severe  negative  symptoms  measured  through  the  PANSS  kept less distance toward angry avatars (r=−0.42, p< 0.05) (20).Cognitive DisabilitiesMultiple research groups investigated cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia patients through VR, especially executive func-tions and memory. Executive functions were assessed through grocery  shopping  in  a  virtual  supermarket  (21),  medication  management  in  a  virtual  apartment  (22),  and  decision  mak-ing on a bus route (23). In all these studies, a comparison was made between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. In general, schizophrenia patients showed more erroneous actions in their grocery shopping and medication management, as well as less flexibility and more stress in the decision-making process on the bus routes. Significant correlations were found between scores on subtests of the supermarket environment and subtests on a standardized executive functioning questionnaire (21). The decision  time  in  the  bus  route  task  was  negatively  correlated  with  negative  symptoms  determined  on  the  PANSS  question-naire (r=−0.76, p= 0.01) for schizophrenia patients.Other  research  groups  investigated  both  spatial  and  working  memory in a virtual maze (24, 25) and a virtual city (26) in schizo-phrenia patients compared to healthy controls. In the maze, patients showed a higher error rate, especially in distractor conditions (24). Furthermore, patients needed more time to complete the task and covered  more  distance  in  both  the  maze  and  the  city  (25, 26).  In  patients,  negative  correlations  were  found  between  both  time  spent on finishing the maze task (r= 0.6, p< 0.001) and covered distance  in  the  city  (r=−0.48, p<  0.001)  and  total  scores  on  a  neuropsychological  battery  indicating  better  short-term  memory  and  spatial  learning  with  better  cognitive  performance  (25, 26). Another  research  group  tested  spatial  memory  on  an  allocentric  and  egocentric  level  (27).  Patients  differed  in  a  higher  number  of  errors and less learning progress over multiple trials on an allocen-tric, but not an egocentric level compared to healthy controls.Developmental DisordersSo  far,  four  studies  have  investigated  VR  environments  in  the  assessment  of  attention-deficit  hyperactivity  disorder  (ADHD)  and eight studies in the assessment of autism.Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity DisorderIn ADHD, the most investigated aspects include errors, distrac-tion,  reaction  time,  and  hyperactivity.  The  research  group  of  Rizzo  et  al.  created  a  virtual  classroom  environment  in  which  participants  are  expected  to  conduct  a  task  from  a  traditional  continuous  performance  test  (CPT)  while  distracting  visual  and auditory stimuli are introduced. The aim was to assess both cognitive  functions  such  as  attention  and  inhibition  and  physi-cal  activity.  In  multiple  studies,  a  comparison  between  ADHD  patients  in  the  age  range  of  8–17  years  and  healthy  controls  revealed  a  significantly  larger  number  of  commission  errors  (28, 29), omission errors (29, 30), and a longer reaction time (30) in ADHD patients. Moreover, ADHD patients also showed more errors  and  an  increasing  reaction  time  when  the  task  had  to  be  repeated  several  times  (28).  Finally,  ADHD  patients  showed  a  higher level of overall physical hyperactivity. This was measured by tracking devices attached to the HMD, the hand, and the knee (29).  In  addition,  a  significant  correlation  was  found  between  the  percentage  of  correct  answers  in  VR  and  a  standard  CPT  (r= 0.64, p< 0.001) (31) Also, measures of correct hits and hit reaction  time  in  VR  and  in  a  standard  CPT  were  significantly  correlated  (coefficient  up  to  0.623,  p<  0.001)  (28)  as  were  the  number  of  errors  and  the  amount  of  hyperactivity  in  VR  and  behavioral  ratings  by  parents  on  a  behavior  checklist  (r=  0.51, r= 0.59 and r= 0.61, respectively) (29).AutismIn autism spectrum disorder (ASD), some studies in this field are directed at the assessment of social behavior in a virtual environ-ment. Emotion recognition, social distance, empathy, and socially appropriate  behavior  were  evaluated.  Emotion  recognition  and  empathy in response to avatar faces showing basic emotions were tested  in  two  studies  (32, 33).  Both  studies  found  the  ASD  and  healthy control groups were equally able to correctly recognize the displayed  emotions;  however,  the  ASD  groups  took  more  time  in  selecting  the  correct  emotion  and  showed  less  confidence  after-wards  (32).  Furthermore,  the  ASD  group  showed  less  congruent  emotions in response to the emotion displayed by the avatar (33). Parsons  et  al.  tested  appropriate  social  behavior  in  a  virtual  bar  (34). Compared to healthy controls, the ASD patients showed less of a tendency to avoid a couple standing at an otherwise empty bar when  ordering  drinks.  Kim  et  al.  found  subjects  with  ASD  were  more likely to virtually distance themselves by using a joystick from a “happy” approaching avatar compared to healthy controls despite correctly identifying the emotion of the avatar (35).Other  studies  in  this  field  are  directed  at  gaining  insight  in  the  pathophysiology  of  ASD  by  studying  neural  mechanisms  of   deviant   non-verbal   behavior   (36).   Four   research   groups   investigated  the  neural  mechanisms  in  response  to  avatar  gaze  direction or duration in ASD subjects (37–40). They consistently found deviations in the networks involved in the theory of mind (ToM) and gaze perception in ASD subjects compared to healthy controls. Von Dem Hagen et al. found an increased activation in both the ToM and gaze perception networks in response to direct gaze  in  healthy  control  and  an  activation  of  the  same  networks  in response to averted gaze in ASD subjects (40). Schulte-Rüther et al. investigated the neural processing of emotional responses to an emotion displayed by an avatar in ASD subjects. They found several deviations, which included an increased activation of the right temporoparietal junction and the dorsal area of the medial prefrontal cortex during processing in ASD subjects, speculating subjects with ASD address different cognitive strategies to access their own emotional state in response to emotions displayed by others (33).Forensic PsychiatryOnly  one  study  evaluated  the  use  of  VR  in  the  assessment  of  forensic  patients.  The  research  group  of  Renaud  et  al.  tested  both  sexual  arousal  and  oculomotoric  response  in  reaction  to  virtual adult and child avatars that were naked in child molesters and  healthy  controls.  They  found  a  more  pronounced  erectile  response  in  child  molesters  in  reaction  to  the  child  avatars,  as  opposed  to  healthy  controls  who  showed  this  response  to  the  adult avatars. Also, a more focused gaze toward the sexual rel-evant areas in all avatars was found in the child molester group, possibly referring to their sexual preoccupation (41).Substance Use DisordersIn  substance  use  disorders,  VR  is  mainly  used  to  study  craving  (42).  Craving  is  an  important  diagnostic  criterion  of  substance  use disorders and is defined as an intense preoccupation or urge to use the desired substance (43). Most of the studies using VR to assess craving in alcohol-, cannabis-, and hard drug depend-ence  focused  on  a  comparison  between  neutral  and  substance  cue-related  VR  environments  in  patients  with  a  substance  use  disorder and did not include a healthy control group.Virtual reality was used to create realistic scenes including sub-stance-related cues, avatars, and even the smell of beer or cannabis. The  studies  generally  showed  a  higher  level  of  subjective  craving  in VR environments containing substance-related cues compared to neutral VR environments (44–48). Only in the study of Saladin et  al.,  physiological  measurements  were  included;  they  found  an  increased  heart  rate  in  the  cue-related  environment  compared  to  the neutral VR environment in cocaine-dependent patients (48).Finally,  in  a  study  by  Lee  et  al.,  a  comparison  was  made  between  alcohol-dependent  patients  and  healthy  controls  (49). They tested a VR environment with alcohol-related cues and an environment  with  avatars  exerting  social  pressure.  Their  results  showed  that  both  patients  and  healthy  controls  experienced  an  increase in subjective craving in response to virtual social pres-sure  in  the  absence  of  alcohol  related  cues.  However,  only  the  alcohol-dependent  patients  experienced  an  increase  in  craving  in response to the VR environment with alcohol-related cues, as opposed to the healthy controls.eating DisordersWe  found  three  studies  using  VR  in  the  assessment  of  eating  disorders,  additionally,  a  review  article  was  identified  (50).  The  studies focused on body image and body dissatisfaction, but also on anxiety and physical reactions in response to virtual food or dining scenarios.Gorini  et  al.  investigated  anxiety  and  physical  reactions  in  response to virtual food (51). In eating disorder patients, anxiety, heart rate, and skin conductance in response to virtual food were significantly higher compared to healthy controls. Ferrer-García et  al.  studied  body-image,  body-dissatisfaction,  and  depressive  and  anxious  symptoms  at  confrontation  with  virtual  dining  scenarios  in  eating  disorder  patients  and  healthy  controls  (52). Patients  showed  more  body  distortion  and  dissatisfaction  in  all  virtual  scenarios  and  a  significantly  higher  level  of  anxiety  and  depression  compared  to  healthy  controls,  especially  in  the  scenarios with high calorie food. The same research group exam-ined  food  craving  in  response  to  virtual  food  in  patients  with  bulimia and binge eating disorder compared to healthy controls. They found a higher level of subjective food craving, determined by a visual analog scale (VAS), in the patient group in response to  the  virtual  food  compared  to  healthy  controls.  They  suggest  this  could  underlie  the  binges  and  higher  BMI  in  patients  with  bulimia and binge eating disorder (53).Mood and Anxiety DisordersWe found just a solitary study on the use of VR in the assessment of  mood  disorders;  Gould  et  al.  studied  the  spatial  memory  of  patients  with  a  depressive  disorder  in  a  virtual  city  were  differ-ent  locations  had  to  be  located  (54).  Depressive  patients  found  significant  fewer  locations  in  the  virtual  city,  and  this  finding  was correlated with the Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (55) (r=−0.33, p= 0.02) and the performance on a spatial working memory task (r=−0.45, p= 0.007).In  anxiety  disorders,  six  studies  were  identified.  We  found  four studies on self-reported and physiological anxiety responses to a virtual tunnel in patients with tunnel phobia (56), to virtual combat scenes in veterans with PTSD (57), in a virtual bus trip in patients with panic disorder (58), and in response to a virtual audience  in  social  anxiety  (59).  In  the  tunnel  phobic  patients  group,  self-reported  anxiety  was  measured  by  means  of  the  subjective unit of discomfort scale (SUDS) (60). Both the self-reported  anxiety  and  heart  rate  increased  with  the  transition  of an open to a tunnel VR-environment. The skin conductance level  was  higher  compared  to  healthy  controls  in  all  environ-ments (56). The veterans with PTSD showed a slower decrease in skin conductance amplitude compared to healthy controls in the course of five virtual combat scenes, possibly indicating slower habituation.  No  correlations  between  the  physiological  meas-ures and the self-reported anxiety and PTSD-related question-naires were determined (57). During a virtual bus trip, patients with panic disorder had higher scores on self-reported anxiety (SUDS),  panic  attack  symptoms  (diagnostic  symptom  ques-tionnaire)  (61),  and  physiological  anxiety  measures  compared  to  healthy  controls  (58).  Cornwell  and  colleagues  investigated  patients with social anxiety in a virtual public speech setting by means of startle reactivity as a physiological anxiety measure in addition to self-reported levels of distress on a VAS. They found significantly  higher  self-reported  anxiety  and  startle  reactivity  in response to focused attention of the audience (59). In all these studies,  the  physiological  anxiety  measures  are  heterogeneous  but generally in line with the self-reported anxiety measures.Finally,  the  research  group  of  Kim  et  al.  developed  a  virtual  house  and  office  for  the  assessment  of  both  anxiety  and  com-pulsions  in  obsessive–compulsive  disorder  (OCD)  (62, 63). They  found  a  higher  level  of  provoked  anxiety  (VAS)  before  and  after  checking  a  situation  in  OCD  patients  compared  to  healthy controls, and a larger decrease in anxiety after checking. Furthermore, a correlation of VR-anxiety with the Yale–Brown Obsessive–Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) (64) and Beck’s Anxiety Inventory  (65)  was  found  (r=  0.35, p<  0.05  and  r=  0.45, p< 0.01). They also found OCD patients showed a higher check-ing frequency, spent more time on checking, a longer trajectory in  the  environment,  and  more  gazing  time  during  checking  behavior.  The  Y-BOCS  was  correlated  with  both  gazing  time  (r= 0.48, p< 0.05) and checking time (r= 0.51, p< 0.05).DiSCUSSiONThe  primary  purpose  of  this  review  was  to  investigate  whether  VR environments used in the assessment of psychiatric disorders were  able  to  show  a  relevant  difference  in  outcome  measures  between patients with a psychiatric disorder and healthy controls. Generally, the virtual environments were able to show significant differences  in  outcome  measures  between  patients  and  healthy  controls. This highlights the great potential of VR in a psychiatric assessment. Only in two studies on emotion recognition in autism and paranoia in psychosis (10, 32), no significant differences were found between patients and healthy controls, probably due to small sample sizes or clinical groups with relatively mild symptoms.The  results  on  the  use  of  VR  in  the  assessment  of  psychotic  disorders  show  virtual  environments  are  capable  of  provoking  paranoid  ideations  and  assess  deficits  in  social  behavior  and  cognitive  disabilities  in  patients.  This  shows  great  potential  for  the assessment of a population that might be more at ease with a computerized assessment than a face-to-face assessment with a clinician. From the studies on VR in ADHD and autism, it is clear that the inclusion of parameters such as hyperactivity measured by tracking devices and neural mechanisms measured by fMRI is of value. If a virtual environment is able to activate both subjective symptoms and the neural and physiological substrate associated with a disorder, this can contribute to a more comprehensive and objective  assessment  of  this  disorder.  For  children  with  ADHD  and  autism,  the  implementation  of  VR  to  assess  symptoms  would  provide  a  more  realistic  and  immersive  experience  than  current  laboratory  settings,  possibly  contributing  to  increased  motivation  and  participation.  In  forensic  psychiatry,  VR  pro-vides  the  opportunity  to  expose  offenders  with  a  psychiatric  disorder  to  potential  risky  situations  in  order  to  evaluate  their  symptoms,  without  posing  an  actual  threat  to  the  environment  (66). Therefore, although research in this area is scarce, forensic psychiatry  has  great  potential  for  VR  assessment.  In  substance  use  disorders  pertaining  the  misuse  of  alcohol-  and  cannabis,  VR seems to be an adequate technique to provoke craving. The addition of olfactory stimuli complements the experience in VR. However,  studies  on  other  substances  including  hard  drugs  are  necessary  before  definite  conclusions  can  be  drawn.  In  eating  disorders, VR has the potential to assess both key symptoms like a  deviant  body  image  and  additional  symptoms  like  anxiety.  In  these  studies,  only  virtual  food  or  dining  scenarios  were  used  to  provoke  symptoms.  It  would  be  interesting  to  explore  more  possibilities,  for  example,  by  assessing  body  image  in  relation  to  avatars  with  various  body  shapes.  The  use  of  VR  in  anxiety  disorders  is  promising  since  physiological  mechanisms  of  the  anxiety  response  are  largely  known.  This  enables  the  inclusion  of  physiological  measures  such  as  heart  rate,  respiration  rate,  and skin conductance in response to a virtual environment, thus contributing to an objective assessment of anxiety (67).Efforts are made to create VR environments to assess multiple symptoms  of  a  disorder;  the  study  of  Rizzo  evaluated  the  most  comprehensive VR environment, evaluating both cognitive func-tions like attention and distractibility and physical activity, which are core symptoms of ADHD (28–31). However, in most of the reviewed  studies,  VR  was  used  to  assess  only  one  symptom  of  the specific disorder. Interestingly, this could be in line with the introduction of dimensional criteria to the categorical diagnostic classification in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual  of  Mental  Disorders  (68).  In  this  edition,  apart  from  marking a symptom as present, dimensions are included to deter-mine symptom severity. It would be worthwhile to investigate if VR  can  be  used  to  measure  the  severity  of  specific  symptoms  transdiagnostically.  More  research  on  the  correlation  between  traditional symptom severity measures and VR environments in patients in different diagnostic categories would be necessary to explore this potential.The second purpose was to determine correlations between VR outcome measures and traditional diagnostic measures in patients with  psychiatric  disorders.  Not  all  studies  included  a  correlation  measurement.  In  14  studies,  significant  correlations  were  found  between  VR  outcome  measures  and  traditional  measures.  The  authors usually expressed a preference for VR because contrary to retrospective traditional measures, in VR, real-time assessments of behavior, affect, and social interaction are possible in response to realistic  environments  resembling  daily  activities  (69).  However,  VR  outcome  measures  were  often  determined  using  symptom  scoring  through  both  state  and  trait  questionnaires  after  immer-sion in the VR environment. State questionnaires are designed to measure  temporarily  induced  symptoms  whereas  trait  question-naires are designed to measure an enduring disposition (70). State questionnaires, like the State Social Paranoia Scale, therefore, seem more  suited  for  this  purpose.  It  could  be  argued  that  short  state  questionnaires obtained during instead of after the VR experience are more objective, though this might disturb the immersion in the virtual environment. The objectivity of a VR measurement can be further improved when other measures are added, such as physical activity,  eye  tracking,  distance  tracking,  physiological  measures,  and  neural  activation.  These  measures  can  often  be  obtained  without  distracting  the  participants  so  the  immersion  in  the  VR  environment is not disturbed. The addition of these measures con-tributes to a more objective assessment of the psychiatric disorder.Since this literature review concerns a novel technique, which has only recently been investigated in the psychiatric diagnostic process, sample sizes of the included studies are generally small. Furthermore,  only  publications  in  the  English  language  have  been included in this review. Due to the great variety in investi-gated virtual environments and outcome measures, merging the results was not possible. More studies with larger sample sizes and more uniformity in outcome measures are necessary to enable a more systematic review including a meta-analysis. Not all studies reported  results  on  correlations  between  the  VR-measures  and  traditional  measures  of  the  aspect  of  the  disorder,  presumably  because  of  small  sample  sizes  or  absence  of  comparable  assess-ment methods. This impairs a conclusion on construct validity.In conclusion, VR shows potential to be implemented in the diagnostic  process.  The  advantages  are  numerous  and  include the use of an immersive, modern technique instead of a standard laboratory  setting  that  could  motivate  participating  patients.  Most of the studies investigated made use of computer-animated VR  environments  with  divergent  levels  of  realism.  New  VR  techniques such as video VR or augmented reality are develop-ing at great speed and will drastically improve the resemblance to  real-life  situations.  This  will  enlarge  the  efficacy  of  virtual  environments  in  assessing  psychiatric  disorders.  Furthermore,  standardized  environments  can  be  created  in  VR  to  ensure  uniformity if the VR is used for research purposes. Finally, the resemblance to real life situations creates enormous opportuni-ties to assess patients in enclosed settings, for example, patients in detention.AUTHOR CONTRiBUTiONSMB, PK, and DD contributed to the conception of this manuscript.

IntroductionChildren have always enjoyed games of “pretend.” While immersed in a game, they often becomedeeply absorbed and able to ignore aversive stimuli. Immersive virtual reality (VR) is a promising andengaging intervention that may help to decrease pain and anxiety for children undergoing painfulprocedures and suffering from acute pain. In the context of their medical care, children may also endurechronic pain and discomfort. Because VR makes it possible to transform how patients perceive theirbodies, it allows other, novel interventions that are possible in no other medium. Beyond providingdistraction and enjoyment, virtual reality may provide a corrective psychological and physiologicalenvironment, and can facilitate rehabilitation for pediatric patients suffering from chronic pain, aswell as neurorehabilitation for children suffering from stroke and cerebral palsy. With the advent ofinexpensive consumer VR systems, the opportunities to research and deploy VR in the clinic haveexpanded. However, the powerful and transformative nature of many VR experiences may also posesome risks and should be utilized with caution in developing therapeutic VR interventions [1].In this paper, we will review recent literature in pediatric virtual reality for procedural pain andanxiety, acute and chronic pain, and some rehabilitation applications. We will also discuss clinically relevant characteristics of VR experiences, such as the aspects of presence, interactivity, customization,social interaction, and embodiment. We will review how each of these requires special consideration,and in some cases adaptation of the hardware or software, for a child population. Finally, we willdiscuss the practical considerations of some currently available consumer VR systems, and offerspecific suggestions and information for clinicians wishing to adopt these engaging therapies.2. Review of Virtual Reality in PediatricsWe conducted a review evaluating articles that describe the use of VR in pediatric procedural,acute and chronic pain. (see Table1) We included articles detailing case studies or randomized trialsof the use of VR. Where such studies were not available, we referred to adult studies that may offerinsights into the potential use in pediatric populations, which are specifically described as pertaining toadult populations. We will discuss the selected articles and themes as they are relevant to the improvedcare of pediatric patients through VR. These articles can be roughly divided into two main areas ofclinical relevance: acute and procedural pain and anxiety, and chronic pain and neurorehabilitation. 2.1. Acute and Procedural PainAcute pain is pain directly related to a temporary injury and typically lasts a short period oftime (<6 weeks). Procedural pain and anxiety refers to distress derived from medical procedures,including intravenous (IV) injections, vaccinations, anesthesia administration, and other needle-relatedprocedures, as well as other procedures required as part of routine care, such as burn wounddressing changes.Virtual reality was first used to manage acute pain during painful repetitive dressing changesin patients with burn wounds [2]. Schmitt et al. demonstrated a reduction in pain of 27–44% inpediatric patients who participated in the virtual environment featuring a wintery scenario, called“SnowWorld”, while undergoing dressing changes [3,4]. Jeffs et al. corroborated the efficacy of VR inburn wound pain management in adolescents [5]. In a randomized three-armed trial, 30 adolescentswere assigned to standard care, watching a movie, and VR engagement with the “SnowWorld” virtualenvironment. The VR treatment group reported a decrease in pain compared to the passive distraction(movie) group, (difference 23.7 points decrease in pain score out of 100 total), 95% confidence interval(CI): 2.4–45.0,p= 0.029). In comparison to standard care, the VR group showed decreased pain aswell, though the difference was not statistically significant. Of note, the VR group was the only one inwhich the patients’ pain during the actual dressing change procedure was reported to be less than thepre-procedure pain [5].Brown et al. performed a randomized controlled trial of an interactive VR intervention entitled“Ditto” and showed not only a decrease in self-reported pain and anxiety in pediatric patientsundergoing dressing changes, but also an increased rate of epithelialization and faster wound healing inthose patients undergoing VR intervention for their procedures (−2.14 days (wounds healed 2.14 days faster), CI:−4.38 to 0.1,p= 0.061), which was significantly faster when adjusted for mean burn depth(−2.26 days, CI−4.48 to−0.04,p= 0.046) [6]. Lastly, Miller et al. showed that not only was painreduced during dressing changes, but when a multimodal intervention was utilized, the procedurerequired less time to complete (p< 0.05) [7]. Additional notable studies investigating the efficacy ofVR distraction on pain and anxiety in children and adults undergoing severe burn wound care arereferenced below [8,9].Virtual reality has also proven successful at lessening procedural pain and distress related to IVplacement and other needle-related procedures. In a 2006 study, Gold et al. performed a randomizedcontrol trial on 20 pediatric patients requiring IV placement [10]. The VR group received a multisensoryVR experience including visual stimulation from a HMD device, tactile feedback, and music, for 5 minprior to IV placement until 5 min after placement. The control group received local anesthetic spray,but no VR intervention for the procedure. They were permitted to utilize the VR equipment for 3 minfollowing IV placement. While children in the control group experienced a four-fold increase in painas measured by the Wong-Baker FACES scale [11], the VR group showed no increase in affective painfollowing IV placement [10]. Nilsson et al. performed a similar study (N= 42) using a screen-basedthree-dimensional (3D) program [12]. Pediatric and adolescent patients undergoing venous puncturesor subcutaneous venous port device insertion were randomized either to this non-immersive VR andstandard care, or standard care alone. Patients did not report a significant decrease in self-reportedpain for either condition; however, they did report that the VR distraction was a pleasant experiencethat succeeded at distraction. (We note that this intervention was not immersive).Beyond VR’s use in acute pain, it can potentially be used to make patients more familiarand comfortable with procedures. Most hospital procedures are accompanied by some stress oranxiety on the part of pediatric patients.  He et al.  looked at the effect of therapeutic play onperioperative anxiety, negative emotional manifestation, and postoperative pain [13]. Ninety-fivechildren were assigned randomly to receive one hour of face-to-face therapeutic play involving objectsto be used in the operation, or no intervention. Those children that participated in therapeutic playexhibited significantly lower levels of anxiety and negative emotion manifestation associated withtheir upcoming operation, and even showed lower levels of post-operative pain [13]. Virtual reality hasthe potential to familiarize children with the operation environment in a safe, controlled and playfulway, and potentially decrease their pain and anxiety.2.2. Chronic PainUnlike procedural or acute pain, chronic pain is persistent for a period greater than six weeks,often for months or years. It may include chronic headache, abdominal, limb, joint or back pain,neuropathic or sympathetically maintained pain such as complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS),and pain related to other medical conditions. In addition to symptom control, interventions oftenstrive to maintain or improve function and minimize disability. While there is little research on usingVR for the treatment of chronic pain in children [14], promising results in adults indicate that furtherresearch in this area is advisable. Below, we describe the use of virtual reality in neuromodulation,in physical therapy, and in biofeedback. We describe the limited research in children, and attempt toextend relevant research in adults to pediatric patients.Virtual reality may have the potential to amplify the neuromodulatory effects of traditional mirrorvisual feedback (MVF), which can modify patients’ pathological cortical representations in the groupof chronic pain syndromes that includes phantom limb pain, complex regional pain syndrome andfibromyalgia. Mirror visual feedback was first applied to adult patients suffering from phantom limbpain (PLP) by Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran [15]. This technique may exert some of itsbenefits by encouraging the remapping of motor and somatosensory cortices, allowing a return toa homeostatic processing mechanism and facilitating the improvement or resolution of the painfulexperience. Mirror visual feedback was also found to be of benefit for CRPS in a randomized controlled trial with adult patients [16]. Virtual reality has also been used in an open-label case study of fiveadults with CRPS, four of whom reported reduced pain intensity over five to eight sessions [17].Besides providing a new medium for mirror therapy, VR also allows other avatar configurationsto be altered. For example, patients can also experience augmented motion such that a small motion inthe physical world maps to a large motion in the virtual one, or vice versa. Thus, a small movementof the arm made in real life could be rewarded by a larger, more apparent arm movement in VR.Conversely, for patients prone to guarding, movements made by patients in real life could be depictedas more restrained in the virtual world [18], which might encourage such patients to move morefreely. Two studies demonstrated that adult patients with neck pain moved further and reported lesspain as a result of movement when VR was used to reduce their apparent movement [18,19]. In thepediatric population, there is currently one feasibility study exploring the neuromodulatory effects ofVR. Won et al. showed that a VR experience with MVF and movement augmentation properties waswell tolerated by pediatric patients with CRPS during physical therapy sessions [20].The hypothesis supporting the efficacy of neuromodulatory chronic pain therapies is foundedin the association between brain connectivity changes and improvement in chronic pain symptoms.A study conducted by Lebel and colleagues found significant changes in the somatosensory processingof symptomatic pediatric CRPS when compared to post-treatment CRPS patients and controlpatients [21]. Because this processing resumes normality after months of traditional physical therapy,it is possible that directly altering somatosensory processing (i.e., via mirror therapy), might itself behelpful in resolving pain. Becerra et al. and Simons et al. [22,23] both showed changes in connectivityin various intrinsic brain networks after therapies that reduced pain and improved function. It is stillunder debate whether the association of successful recovery from CRPS symptoms is directly relatedto changes in brain connectivity or brain plasticity, and further research is required to determine whatother factors may be involved in remapping somatosensory processing [24]. However, another pieceof evidence supporting this hypothesis comes from graded motor imagery, a therapy that involves theimaginary mental rotation of one’s limbs. Adult studies have shown that this therapy is associatedwith both changes in connectivity in the central nervous system as well as reduction in pain [25], andpediatric patients may also benefit from such therapy.As discussed above, VR offers an engaging opportunity for children to practice motions thatwould be impossible or unsafe in the real world [26]. Especially in diseases like cerebral palsy, wheremotion is difficult, the opportunity to engage in active/repetitive motor and sensory practice canincrease neuroplasticity and allow for learning to overcome some limitations of the disease [27].In a study by Biffi et al., 12 children with Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) participated in 10 sessions usingan interactive VR system called GRAIL (Gait Real-time Analysis Interactive Lab); treatment sessionsled to improvement in walking abilities and enhanced engagement during training, suggesting thatVR may play a role in the field of rehabilitation [28]. Although not discussing efficacy, Meyns et al.demonstrated the feasibility of using VR training to improve balance in children with cerebral palsyafter lower limb surgery [29]. For a more in-depth review on neurorehabilitation applications of VR,please refer to the following excellent review by Wang et al. [26].In addition to alterations in neuronal representation, patients with chronic pain often exhibita debilitating fear of inducing more pain through movement. This fear not only seriously affectspatients’ ability to function; it can also inhibit physical therapy efforts. Trost et al. discusses the use ofVR interventions to provide graded exposure treatment for pain-related fear and disability in adultswith chronic low back pain [30]. Collado-Mateo et al. also found that a combined program of physicalexercise and non-immersive VR improved adult patients’ mobility, balance, and fear of falling in adultfibromyalgia patients [31]. Senkowski et al. cite significant promise in the use of VR-assisted therapyto aid in the decrease of fear-avoidance behavior and improvement in distorted body images [32].Fear-avoidance is noted to be an issue in the pediatric population with chronic pain [33]; however,no VR interventions have yet been specifically designed to address this phenomenon. 2.3. Other ApplicationsAnother possible application is the use of a virtual pain coach.  A VR experience couldreinforce therapeutic movements and exercises in an out-of-clinic environment. This is especiallyuseful for long-distance patients or patients who are unable to be physically present for otherreasons [34]. The variety of VR therapy options makes it an effective intervention to integrate intoexisting interdisciplinary programs, combining medical treatment, physical therapy and psychologicalinterventions [35].Finally, the effects of VR may potentially be augmented by other techniques such as biofeedbackor hypnosis. Biofeedback is the process of providing the patient with information on his or her ownneurological data such as heart rate variability, temperature, or muscle tension. In a recent pilot study,non-immersive VR mirror visual feedback was used successfully in combination with biofeedback totreat pediatric patients with chronic headaches [36]. Virtual reality was also used in conjunction withhypnosis in an adult case report [37].3. Qualities of Virtual RealityIn the next section, we will discuss five qualities of VR that are of interest in considering clinicalapplications for children: presence, interactivity, social interactions, customization, and embodiment.We will then summarize current research on how these qualities may be useful for treating children,and note some potential areas of caution (see Table2). 3.1. PresencePresence is the subjective feeling that the user is experiencing the environment and interactions inthe virtual world are [38]. It is often measured by self-report, has been linked to physiological processessuch as changes in hear rate and skin resistance [39] and behavioral measures such as not respondingto stimuli in the real world [40]. Feelings of presence can be evoked by even a simple VR system, suchas a 360◦video viewed through a smartphone in a cardboard housing. However, a recent meta-analysisindicates that features such as improved tracking, stereoscopy, and wide field of view can make VRexperiences feel more real [1]. VR is particularly promising as a distractor for procedural and acutepain because of the deep sense of presence created by virtual worlds. The immersive features of virtualreality technology immerse the patient with rich sensory stimuli, creating a realistic experience andeffectively directing attention away from adverse stimuli [41,42].Age may influence how virtual environments are experienced. For example, during burn woundcare treatment with VR, pediatric patients reported higher levels of presence compared to adultsreceiving the same treatment [43]. Experiencing virtual environments as extremely real has importantimplications for how children behave and understand the world after the VR treatment. Baumgartneret al. showed that children’s brains process virtual experiences differently than adults and young children may require different types of immersive experiences [44]. During early childhood (e.g., threeto five-years-old) children’s sense of fantasy and reality is rapidly developing [45,46]. Virtual realitycan create realistic environments that may seem extremely real, particularly to young children.Given that children may be more vulnerable to believing virtual experiences as real, virtualenvironments may need to be carefully selected and contextualized so that children are able tointerpret their memories of the experience as derived from media rather than real life. In addition,for some age groups, debriefing post-VR experience may be necessary.3.2. InteractivityVirtual reality therapies incorporating tracked body movements allow for greater interactivity.In a study examining cold pressor-induced pain in 40 children of age 5–13, greater interactivity ledto greater pain tolerance [47]. Children with disorders requiring intensive physical therapy, such asthose with CRPS [20] or cerebral palsy [48], may benefit especially from interactive VR scenarios. Suchscenarios can encourage them to engage in physical therapy while simultaneously increasing theirpain tolerance.High levels of interactivity, while effective in reducing pain, can be accompanied by a sense ofnausea and increased potential for collisions with objects in the real world. Clinicians using VR astherapy should be aware of these minor risks and take appropriate precautions for pediatric patients.The more immersed users are in a virtual environment, the more the sensory input from the real worldis occluded, and active users risk painful collisions.Even adults can be at risk of falling or colliding with objects; during set-up, consumer VR systemsrequire users to define a safe “play space”, and displays are equipped with safety warnings andreminders to be careful when users approach the edge of this area. As children move around a virtualspace, they may come dangerously close to objects in the real world. Even if children are seated,they should be monitored. Careful spotting is necessary to prevent them from injuring themselves orbystanders by accidentally colliding with real-world objects.In addition, although both children and adults can be prone to “cybersickness” or feeling nauseaor dizziness, children may be less able to anticipate and articulate their discomfort. Caretakers andclinicians will need to be aware of the possible signs of sickness and develop ways to measure children’sdiscomfort in non-verbal and unobtrusive ways such as how children are moving their bodies. Anotheralternative is to set pre-determined timers to take short breaks.3.3. Social Interactions in Virtual RealityMany factors affect children’s and adolescents’ attraction to video games, one being their abilityto share the experience with friends [49]. The use of social interactions may be particularly effectiveduring adolescence, a time in which children are particularly sensitive to social environments [50].Children as young as five years old respond to digital others in social ways, such as using informationfrom a virtual character and a live person at equal rates to solve a decision-making task [51].Children with chronic pain may have particular deficiencies in their abilities to develop andmaintain peer relationships due to increased school absences, decreased physical ability to engage insports or social activities, and decreased mood and motivation [52]. Virtual environments may offeran alternative platform for children to build these relationships by giving them access to near-realexperiences that they can share with others. Children with high medical acuity, such as those inpost-transplant oncology, who may be confined to a single room or unit, may benefit from access tovirtual interactions if they are not able to engage with peers due to their ongoing medical condition.Since older children are already actively involved in virtual environments [53], the presence ofvirtual others offers new opportunities. For example, physical therapists might incorporate theirown behavior into the environment via an avatar, which could help patients visualize or mimic thecorrect movements. However, as in real life, children need age-appropriate environments. Social virtual environmentswhere children can interact with others such as High Fidelity (highfidelity.io) or AltspaceVR(altVR.com) may require additional permissions so that outsiders cannot interact with patients.In addition, the risks and benefits of social media are also applicable when social media platformsprovide opportunities for patients to engage virtually. While Facebook’s current beta application,Spaces (oculus.com/experiences/rift/), and other environments linked with social media platformsmay make it easy for children to engage with Facebook friends in immersive virtual reality, suchinteractions should not allow children to isolate themselves from face-to-face interactions.3.4. CustomizationClinicians or patients themselves can select different virtual scenarios, and as commercial VRexperiences become more common, there will be more entertainment options from which to choose.Allowing children to contribute towards selecting their virtual experience allows them agency and theability to tailor content to their interests, as in a study by Ni et al. [54] in which pediatric patients andtherapists evaluated games for degree of engagement and therapeutic usefulness together. For example,children undergoing chemotherapy who selected from a variety of virtual scenarios demonstratedreduced symptom distress [55].Another area in which customization can be advantageous is in avatar representation. Childrencan select and customize their own avatar, providing them with a sense of control in a clinical settingthat can significantly reduce patient stress [56]. When embodying stock avatars, children may needguidance in selecting age-appropriate material, as research suggests that users may conform theirbehavior to their preconceptions about the avatars they embody [57,58].3.5. EmbodimentWhen body trackers, such as hand trackers, are used in virtual reality, participants can move theirtracked limbs in real life and see their movements represented by the movements of their avatars invirtual reality. Thus, when patients are embodied in an avatar, they gain the sense that their avatarbody has replaced their real body. This allows interventions that are possible in no other medium.The tracking capabilities inherent in embodied VR experiences also offer clinicians the abilityto monitor their patients’ physical movements and quantify rehabilitative effort without relying onself-report data. As wearable monitors for tracking physiological data such as gait and posture becomeincreasingly used, clinicians may observe their patients on multiple levels and tailor their treatmentaccordingly. As with all patient data, movement data in children must be carefully protected.Movement is not the only aspect of patient activity that can be visualized. Biofeedback is one arenathat would lend itself well to the flexibility of virtual reality, allowing the visualization of pain-linkedphysiological signals. This could be particularly useful for children who may not be as adept as adultsat verbally describing sensory information, or translating verbal instruction into action. An example isdescribed in a recent pilot study mentioned above, where non-immersive VR mirror visual feedbackwas used in combination with biofeedback to treat pediatric patients with chronic headaches [56].In VR, patients can also be embodied in novel avatars, or avatars that do not conform to thelimitations of their physical bodies [57,58]. As discussed above, Jäncke et al. propose that childrenmay be more susceptible than adults to developing a feeling of presence in virtual environments, evenin novel avatar bodies [59]. Thus, as with virtual environments, the experience of embodiment in anavatar, especially an avatar that is dissimilar to a child’s real body must be contextualized. Debriefingpost-VR may be necessary. 4. Practical Aspects of Virtual Reality: Hardware and SoftwareClinicians looking to integrate virtual reality into their practice may benefit from the followinginformation about the strengths and limitations of current consumer VR set-ups.At a minimum, virtual reality requires a display in which the user sees the virtual environment. Inthe most common consumer systems, this is done through a head-mounted display (HMD). An HMDis a type of VR headset that displays digital images on two screens in front of the user’s eyes. Inphone-based VR systems such as Gear VR, Google Cardboard or Google Daydream, the HMD consistsof a smartphone wrapped in an inexpensive case with lenses, such that the phone provides both thecomputing power and display. In more powerful VR systems, such as the Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, thecontent displayed on the headset is generated by a desktop or laptop computer certified as “VR ready”by the manufacturer, or, in the case of PlayStation, by a video game console. In all of these systems,the user’s movements are tracked, and the system updates the content that is displayed to the userbased on these tracked movements. Thus, as a child turns her head when looking around a virtualenvironment through an HMD, the content updates on the screens in front of her eyes, just as it wouldin the physical world if she turned her head to look at a different part of the room. Brief descriptionsof some currently available consumer systems are found in Table3.4.1. Tracking MovementTracking users’ movements while they experience VR is a key factor in creating realisticand compelling scenarios [1].  Two kinds of tracking are used in VR: orientation and position.Orientation, shown in Figure1, tracks the user’s head movements and allows her to gaze around hervirtual environment. In VR systems that only have orientation, users are unable to move through scenes using theirown body movement (i.e., walking). Instead, users might navigate through virtual environments usinggaze, touchpad input or other less-embodied navigation techniques. Currently, smartphone-baseddevices tend to track only head orientation. While these systems are more limited in some respects,they are generally portable and self-contained, and require very little set-up time or space to use. Theyare also lighter, cheaper and potentially easier to clean and/or have disposable components, all ofwhich may provide significant advantages when using them for pediatric patients.In addition to orientation tracking, systems can also have positional tracking (e.g., movingforwards or backwards in VR). Position, shown in Figure2, tracks the user’s body and allows him torelocate within his environment. If the user holds hand trackers, his or her hands will also be tracked.This allows the user to interact with objects in the environment using his or her hands, and optionally see his or her hands represented by an avatar’s hands. Positional tracking typically uses externalsensors placed around a room that capture the position of the headset and/or additional trackedobjects. Such systems allow users to walk around in the virtual space. While they increase the level of interaction available, systems with sophisticated trackingcapabilities that include hand trackers tend to be more expensive than those that only captureorientation. While still portable to an extent, more complex systems also require sufficient spacefor patients to safely move around, and the headsets may be heavier. They will also require moreset-up time.4.2. Hardware Issues to Consider for ChildrenAlthough consumer headsets are designed to be adjustable, they can be too heavy or too large tobe easily used by smaller children, as Dahlquist, et al. speculate in their 2009 study [41]. An additionalissue for hospital use is that headsets, along with hand-tracking devices, which come into close contactwith users’ bodies, will need to be cleaned.These issues and more can be easily addressed through modular additions and adaptations to thebasic VR unit, which would allow the technology to be effective in a wide range of clinical situations.Some consumer systems have washable covers to protect the parts of the headset that come into contactwith patients’ skin. Cleansing wipes can also be used on both trackers and sensors. In a 2014 studyon a patient who had burn wounds on his head, a consumer HMD was mounted to an articulatedarm so that the patient did not actually need to wear the device [9]. Very young children may alsoneed the unfamiliar equipment to be decorated or disguised to be more appealing. As one of theauthors has found, by introducing an HMD as a mask with a soft cover designed with a friendlyface, children were more open to wearing the virtual reality equipment [60]. If trends in lightness,portability, and decreased price continue, VR systems are likely to become increasingly better adaptedfor pediatric patients. 4.3. Virtual ContentResearchers seeking virtual content have three options. They may use existing free or inexpensiveconsumer content. They may develop their own content. Finally, they may work with industry partnersfocused on the clinical use of virtual reality. The following section lists some resources available atpress time.Free or pre-existing games designed for virtual reality are becoming increasingly available andmay be an appropriate option, particularly for procedural pain. Such games can be purchased anddownloaded; for example, through the Steam and Oculus libraries. Another type of frequently freevirtual content is 360◦videos, which can be downloaded directly to the device. Some main contentlibraries are currently YouTube360, Within, Jaunt, NYTVR, Condition One, WSJ, and LifeVR [61]. Mostcontent in these libraries consists of 360◦videos, which allow for orientation tracking without muchinteraction. Finally, social interactions in a virtual space can be facilitated using social platforms suchas Facebook Spaces, High Fidelity, AltSpaceVR, etc.Virtual content can be also created for specific clinical purposes using development platforms suchas Unity3D (unity3d.com), Unreal (unreal.com) and Vizard (vizard.com). Researchers seeking to createcustomized content, which might include those investigating rehabilitation or neurorehabilitation,may require specialized tracking and rendering or customization. Such researchers might considercollaborating with university departments, for example computer science, information science, orcommunication departments, or work with existing software companies. Recording one’s ownimmersive video is also an option. Cameras ranging in complexity and price from the hundredsto thousands of dollars allow researchers to record their own video content and prepare it for viewingthrough a phone-based HMD.Finally, there is increasing commercial interest in supplying clinicians with virtual realityapplications. While it is outside the scope of this paper to recommend specific companies, searching for“virtual reality therapy” online will provide a list of suppliers. In addition, it is possible to make somerecommendations for clinicians to take into consideration when working with a supplier. If patientdata is collected as part of treatment, it may raise confidentiality issues. Developers should haveexperience working in a clinical setting. Compatibility with hardware should also be considered,as some application developers use proprietary hardware, while others allow the use of consumersystems. A brief list of currently available free games can be found in Table4, below. While more research is necessary to determine the more complex aspects of VR in pediatric care,VR can be used immediately to improve the quality of life for pediatric patients. A clinician may orderone of the above-mentioned devices to be kept in the clinic and made available to patients who requireone of the procedures described earlier in this review. For example, a child might be given a headsetand immersed in a relaxing forest scene while they are receiving an immunization or IV placement.Alternatively, a child requiring frequent dressing changes, or other painful procedures may chooseto purchase a unit for home use to assist with pain management. A patient with chronic pain mayfind it beneficial to use VR interventions to temporarily alleviate symptoms, or to assist in performingchallenging tasks while in physical or occupational therapy. The number of applications is unlimited,and can be adapted to the individual child’s interests and the clinical therapeutic need.5. ConclusionsIn summary, VR is a promising new technology that offers unique opportunities to modulate theexperience of pain. These opportunities include the management of acute and procedural pain andfamiliarizing children with future procedures via simulation. In addition, extrapolating from currentevidence in adults, we propose that virtual reality may assist in the treatment of pediatric chronic painvia neuromodulation, as well as physical therapy.Given the reduction in cost and increased ease of access, we hope that clinicians will be encouragedto explore the potential of this new modality. While the immediate adoption of VR can already engageand entertain children in a clinical setting with potential therapeutic benefits, continued study ofthe applications and efficacy of virtual reality in the treatment of pediatric pain is needed to betterunderstand the impact upon quality of life for pediatric patients.

For example, VR-based behavioral interventions have been used todecrease acute pain among individuals undergoing painful medical procedures (e.g. woundcleaning of burn injuries [14,15,22,10], urological endoscopies (36)), physical therapy (e.g.for blunt force trauma [16], for burned skin [12,13]), and dental pain [11,5], andexperimental pain in healthy volunteers (e.g. thermal pain) [17,18]. Although these datasuggest that VR has promise as a tool to help reduce acute pain, there has been limitedinvestigation on the use of VR in the treatment of patients with persistent pain.\r\nThe purpose of this topical review is to identify and highlight ways in which VR can be usedeither alone or in combination with other treatments for persistent pain. The review isdivided into three parts. First, we briefly describe VR methods currently used in themanagement of acute pain. Second, we discuss several potential applications of VR as abehavioral intervention for persistent pain. Third, we highlight important future directionsfor research in this area.Virtual Reality for Acute Pain: Previous ResearchVR-based behavioral interventions have been used in acute pain management for over adecade [12]. VR-based interventions often have been developed as an adjunctiveintervention designed to distract patients from acute pain that has not responded toconventional approaches (e.g. opioid medications) [10,14,22,13]. The rationale for usingVR-based distraction for acute pain is that since pain requires conscious attention, VR drawsattention into the computer-generated world, leaving less attention available to processincoming pain signals.In most VR approaches to acute pain management, an immersive virtual environment isselected that is likely to divert attention away from acute pain such as Snow World [10,22].In Snow World, patients can use a computer mouse to maneuver around and interact with(e.g. by throwing snowballs at snowmen, penguins, and wooly mammoths) a snow coveredvirtual environment while listening to music. Display devices that can be used to displayvirtual environments used in distraction interventions can range in complexity and cost fromfully immersive environments such as Snow World displayed in a wide field of view, high-resolution head-mounted display on the high end, to desktop computers using inexpensivepolarized or shutter glasses in combination with stereoscopic projectors or large 3-Dmonitors.Potential Applications of VR to Persistent PainVR for DistractionDistraction methods such as counting strategies, visual distraction, and audio distraction arecomponents of many cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols for chronic pain [20,34].The question arises: under what conditions might VR prove particularly useful or necessaryas a distraction method for chronic pain? VR may be particularly useful for individuals withpersistent pain who have difficulty diverting their attention away from or disengaging theirattention from ongoing pain [32].There is evidence that VR can enhance the level of immersion in a distracting environmentand that this occurs even when an individual is experiencing pain (32). Repeated VR trials inwhich a person with persistent pain is exposed in a laboratory to a highly engaging virtualenvironment (e.g. SnowWorld [10]) are one way to build confidence in one\'s ability to usedistraction for pain control. One might expect an enhanced sense of immersion if the VRtechnology uses head, hand, or body tracking to foster interaction with the scene [19]. Newhaptic devices potentially enable one to combine visuals, sound, touch, and smell (olfactorydisplays) that can further enhance a sense of immersion.VR for Pain-related Movement PatternsOne of the major challenges of living with persistent pain is that pain is typically increasedwhen a patient moves the painful body area. The increases in pain that occur duringmovement can be substantial and can lead patients to avoid and become fearful of dailyactivities such as walking, transferring from one position to another, etc [33].VR potentially provides a way of exposing patients to movements that they may avoidbecause of pain or fear. One can also easily move a patient from one VR environment toanother thereby enabling rapid and broad exposure to many different challenges. Alongthese lines, Gromala, et al. [9] have used VR to help patients cope with pain that can occurduring walking. They have developed a virtual walk in which the patient is on a treadmillwhile wearing VR headgear. The patient is watching an avatar that is walking in a slow andmindful fashion through a virtual environment. During the walk physiological responses aremonitored and visual (3D display) and auditory feedback is provided to the patient with thegoal of fostering relaxation and decreasing pain. Araceneaux, et al. [1] also have described aVR device for managing walking-related pain.Recent advances in VR technology designed to accurately simulate walking and stoppingduring interaction with topographical features (e.g. experiencing the slope force simulatingthe grade of a virtual hill) or virtual stair climbing offer the possibilities of enhancing thesense of immersion and presence of such treadmill-based VR walking environments [35,4].VR technology can also be used to simulate movement of specific body parts that the patientis unable to control or avoids using. Cole et al [3] have recently shown VR is an effectiveway to reduce phantom limb pain in both arm and leg amputees, using motion capture frompatients’ stumps to generate simulated motion in a virtual limb. When compared to a controlgroup using basic pain distraction methods, amputees using this VR technology reportedsignificantly lower levels of phantom pain in the affected arm or leg. In a small series ofamputees having phantom limb pains (n=5) VR has been used to provide mirror visualfeedback of movement patterns that reduces pain [26]. Ramachandran & Seckel [31] havesuggested a similar approach could be used to treat persons with fibromyalgia whoexperience pain during movement.Integrating VR with Other Behavioral InterventionsVR also can be combined with other behavioral interventions that are currently being usedto treat persistent pain. The behavioral intervention that has received the most attention inVR pain research is hypnosis. David Patterson [29] pioneered the use of hypnosis deliveredvia a VR environment in the treatment of pain. In a case study of a patient having a severeburn injury, he found that a VR hypnosis protocol reduced pain by up to 40%. A subsequentseries of 13 cases of patients with burn injuries by this group [30] found the VR hypnosisnot only produced substantial decreases in pain and anxiety but also reduce patients\'requirements for opioid medications by 50%. Oneal, Patterson, Soltani, et al. [27] publishedthe first study to test the effects of a VR hypnosis protocol for chronic pain. In this study, theeffects of 33 sessions of VR hypnosis was evaluated in a patient with chronic neuropathicpain who had failed to respond to prior conventional medical treatment. Following VRsessions the patient reported either no pain or a reduction of pain for hours afterward. Alimitation of the study, however, was that one month after completing treatment the patient\'spain ratings had returned to their pre-treatment level. Further research is needed todetermine whether a greater dose of VR or additional training in maintenance strategiescould enhance the long-term effects of this VR protocol.There are several reasons for integrating VR with established behavioral interventions forpain [2]. First, such a combined intervention may be beneficial for patients who fail torespond to a conventional behavioral treatment such as meditation or hypnosis [27]. Second,VR can standardize the presentation of images, instructions, and environmental sounds usedin hypnosis (or other behavioral interventions) for persistent pain [2, 28]. Finally, oncepatients have achieved enhanced pain control via a combined VR/behavioral interventionprotocol, they may be more motivated and more successful with practicing the behavioralintervention on its own in their home environment. Given the promising results of VR hypnosis for acute pain, future research seems warranted to explore other proposed VR/behavioral treatment combinations (e.g. VR in combination with meditation [8] or VR incombination with exposure therapy [24].Future DirectionsVR technologies are rapidly evolving. One of the most promising areas for future study isdeveloping and evaluating tailored VR environments that are optimally effective in paincontrol for a given patient. In the future it may be practical to tailor VR environments on thebasis of visual, auditory, tactile [32] and even olfactory stimuli [6]. Tailoring of VR not onlycould enhance the sense of immersion and presence in the VR environment, it could alsoenhance pain control, thereby making training processes more efficient and more readilyavailable to larger numbers of patients. As costs of VR equipment continue to drop andincreasingly accessible ways of delivering VR become available (e.g. VR delivered by homecomputers coupled with low cost 3D television displays and 3 D input devices), it willbecome more practical to use home-based training for patients having persistent pain.Several key questions remain to be addressed if the promise of home-based VR for paincontrol is to become a reality. First, we need to better understand the mechanism(s) bywhich VR effects pain. If VR primarily works through distraction then efforts should bemade to ensure that the displays used continue to be sufficiently complex and novel. On theother hand if VR works by fundamentally altering the way we think and perceive of reality(e.g. by creating a sense of being present in a different state) then the technology requiredmay simply need to be sufficient to create a sense of immerssion. Second, developmentalresearch is needed to ensure that specialized VR pain control applications work as well inthe home as, for example, a game played on a game console. Much of this work will be atthe human-computer interface space where methods need to be developed to ensure that VRapplications work as well at home as in lab settings. There may also be challenges on thehardware side, though new technologies may help. For example, Microsoft Kinect is a new,camera-based VR input device that is unobtrusive and eliminates the need for wires andgloves. New displays such as autostereoscopic displays (no glasses needed) are likely toprovide a more user friendly component that is much less prone to breaking, running out ofbattery power, or otherwise causing problems that could disrupt home-based VR training.There is clear need for studies to help develop and refine VR protocols for managingpersistent pain. First, the efficacy of VR in different populations of persons having persistentpain needs to be determined. The efficacy of VR for persistent pain may vary across agegroups. Recent evidence indicates that older adults report lower ratings of pain whenexposed to pain while being presented with an immersive VR protocol [21]. Third, newsoftware technologies are needed to support the creation of custom environments. New 3Dmodeling and VR design software may be developed with the goal of making designingcustom VR therapies as easy as sketching a storyboard and related 3D models, perhaps as inthe style of Google SketchUp (http://sketchup.google.com/).One important research issue is how to enhance generalization of treatment effects from aVR environment to daily situations in which pain is a problem. Several strategies could beused. First, lab based (or home based) VR training could be combined with a \"moreportable\" behavioral intervention. Second, one can now construct a 3D stereoscopic VRdisplay for a smartphone that can be linked to customizable VR software (http://projects.ict.usc.edu/mxr/diy/) that could potentially be adapted for use in pain management.Finally, in VR one can directly expose patients to progressively more difficult pain-relatedsituations inside the clinic in order to foster more adaptive coping responses to pain.In summary, research on VR interventions for persistent pain is in its infancy. Thistechnology, however, holds considerable promise. It is our hope that pain researchers andclinicians will more actively pursue research and clinical efforts so that this promise may berealized.AcknowledgmentsThe authors would like to thank Vicky Gandhi and Sarah Rowe for their help in preparing this manuscript forsubmission.

To date, no systematicreview has been conducted on the useof VR in the inpatient medical setting.Herein, we review controlled studies evaluating the utility and efficacy of VR-based treatments for patients admitted to hospitals or rehabilitation centers.VR and its use in healthcare.VR refers to the interactions between an individual and a computer-generated environment stimulating multiple sensory modalities, including visual,auditory, or haptic experiences.9Theuser’s perception of reality is facilitatedby the use of head-mounted displays (HMDs, in goggles or headsets), wall projectors, and/or gloves fitted with sensors or touch-sensitive motors.Sensors may allow researchers to monitor and record a patient’s level ofinteractivity (known as “immersion” or“presence”) in a way that is reliable,safe, and replicable.3VR’s immersive, entertaining effects are useful for redirecting the patient’s attention away from painful treatment experiences and reducing anxiety,discomfort, or unpleasantness.12VR has been utilized in many studies to distract(often pediatric) patients during wound redressing in burn care, and in exposure therapy for phobias or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a substitute for imagination of a feared environment.7VR has been used to treat eating disorders and obesity, allowing patients to improve body image perceptions and promote healthier eating habits by inhabiting realistic avatars in stress-inducing virtual situations, such as food shopping.7VR is also used for patient motor rehabilitation, aiding patients to reacquire specific skills and improve body movement in virtual environments that are less dull or discouraging than standard gym exercises.METHODSLiterature search strategy.Wereviewed all controlled trials of VR ininpatient medical settings published overthe last 10 years. We used PsycINFO,PubMed, and Medline electronicdatabases to identify studies from 2005to 2015, based on the followingkeywords: virtual reality, VR therapy,treatment, and inpatient. We alsoreviewed reference lists of previousreviews and meta-analyses to identifytitles not captured in our initial search.We excluded trials with no control orcomparison group, case studies,outpatient studies, theses ordissertations, and articles not publishedin the English language. As displayed inFigure 1, our initial search yielded 2,024citations of journal articles written inEnglish over the last decade. Wediscarded 1,966 citations not involvinginpatient populations and reviewed theremaining 58 studies in more detail. Weexcluded 42 of these studies because they did not meet all inclusion criteria,were duplicates, or because the full text was not available. We grouped the final11 eligible studies based on their application of VR to three broad medical conditions: pain distraction, eating disorders/obesity, and cognitive/motor rehabilitation. These studies are described in Table 1. Evaluation of study quality.To evaluate the strength of scientific evidence reported in these studies, we utilized a measure developed by Reisch,Tyson, and Mize, chosen among several measures reviewed and approved by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).13,14We selected the Reisch measure because it can be used for both observational studies and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and thoroughly assesses many important domains, including the following: study purpose, experimental design, sample size determination, description and suitability of subjects, randomization and stratification, usage of control/comparison group, treatment procedures, blinding, attrition, subject and treatment evaluation metrics, data analysis and presentation, and treatment recommendations. The measure aggregates data on 34 attributes within these 12 domains to produce a quality ratio (0–1), and can be adjusted to exclude attributes that do not apply to a given study. For example, blinding to the usage of VR is impossible by design, so this domain was not included in our evaluation of study quality.Two raters (study authors JR andMR) scored each VR trial, utilizing a subset of applicable questions that totaled 27 points. After each rater completed a review of one of the VR trials, the raters conferred and discusseddifferences in scoring. Then, each raterreviewed the complete set of articlespresented herein.15We assessed inter-rater reliability by computing Cohen’s Kappa statistic.16Because of theapparent heterogeneity of studies andinconsistency of reported results, weopted not to conduct a meta-analysis.RESULTSOverview.We identified 11 controlledstudies of medical inpatients for thecurrent review, but only eight studiesrandomized patients to VR conditions, orrandomized the order of delivery of VRor standard interventions usingcrossover designs. We observed thatstudies were heterogeneous with regardto targeted disease state, VR equipmentand intervention materials, andoutcomes assessed. Thus, wecategorized results within eachapplication of VR to medical inpatients. Study quality.Studies varied in termsof quality (average quality score=0.87;standard deviation [SD]=0.06;range=0.78–0.96).13The raters were instrong agreement on most study qualitydomains assessed (Cohen’s κ=0.84). Nostudies defined the magnitude of theoutcome to be evaluated (e.g., a 20%drop in pain GRS scores) or explicitlydiscussed cost-effectiveness, althoughfour studies did consider VR devicecost.15,17–19Five of the 11 studies usedsmall samples (i.e., n<30), as expectedin a novel technology efficacy trial.19–23Notably, the lowest rated study(Patterson et al21) and the highest ratedstudy (Schmitt et al15) were authored bymembers of the same study team.15,21Lower quality studies utilized smallersamples, did not randomize participants,and did not consider all factorsassociated with treatment (e.g., cost,adherence, side effects). Higher quality studies conformed to the expectedstructure of an RCT, justified and utilized larger samples, and considered patient side effects. We observed no temporal patterns in study quality, and found no associations between targeted disease state and quality score.Pain distraction.As shown in Table1, VR is used for pain management in inpatient populations more commonly than for other applications. Most researchers utilized the SnowWorld VRsystem (University of Washington HITLab and Harborview Burn Center,Seattle Washington)—the first VR software created for pain control during burn wound redressing—consisting ofan HMD through which patients view and interact with snow-themed characters and throw virtual snow ballsat approaching snowmen via a computer mouse or keyboard.20,24In a first-of-its-kind study of burn victims using SnowWorld, Hoffman et al20observed a41-percent reduction in pain in the VR condition versus a control group, as well a strong negative correlation between self-reported “immersion” in the VR environment and pain ratings. Schmitt etal15observed significant reductions in cognitive pain (time spent thinking about pain, reduced 44%), affective pain(emotional unpleasantness, reduced32%), and sensory pain (reduced 27%),as well as highly positive feelings toward the VR intervention (which many labelledas “fun”). Carrougher et al17alsoobserved reductions in pain unpleasantness (31%), time spent thinking about pain (31%), and worstpain experienced (27%) in VRconditions, but did not observestatistically significant improvements inrange of motion (ROM) physical therapy,which consists of assisted exercisesdesigned to help patients gainmovement in affected body segments(e.g. hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, knee,or ankle). A study by Patterson et al21assessedthe analgesic efficacy of virtual realityhypnosis (VRH), a new procedure inwhich the hypnotist verbally expressessuggestions that focus the patient’sattention away from pain. Based onscores obtained both immediately afterthe interventions and eight hours later,VRH patients reported lessunpleasantness and less pain intensitythan both control groups (VR withouthypnosis, or standard analgesictreatment alone). Two studies of burn patients utilizinglow-cost, easily accessible andaffordable VR HMD systems (Z8003DVisor, eMagin, New York, New York)and off-the-shelf software computergames did not report significantdifferences in self-reported painmeasures or anxiety (see Table 2 fordetailed descriptions of scales used).Morris et al19compared adult burnpatient exposure to VR (video gamesplus analgesics) to a control condition(analgesics alone) and found amarginally significant difference in painreduction between conditions (p=0.06),but no significant decreases in self-reported anxiety. In the Kipping et alstudy,18patients did not report decreasesin pain during burn wound redressing,but nursing staff observed significantreductions.One study utilized wall projectionsand motion detection instead of HMDsto examine the effectiveness oftherapeutic play for reducing depressivesymptoms in pediatric oncologypatients.25After a week of treatment,children in the experimental groupreported significantly fewer depressivesymptoms than those in the controlgroup, but they did not report significantdifferences in state anxiety. Eating disorders (EDs) and obesity.Two recent studies investigating theefficacy of VR treatment in populationswith EDs are presented in Table 1. Cesaet al26assessed the brief and long-termefficacy of VR plus cognitive-behavioraltherapy in a group of 90 female patientswith obesity at an inpatient rehabilitationclinic. In the VR treatment arm,participants wore HMDs and navigatedthrough 14 different virtualenvironments. Patients were exposed totempting situations (e.g., buying unhealthy food at the supermarket) to improve self-control and motivation, aswell as situations that challenged negative body image (e.g., swimming pool). Although improvements in body satisfaction were reported in all study conditions, only patients in the VR condition reported improved body image perceptions at five-week follow-up. After one year, VR patients were significantly better (44.4%) at improving or maintaining weight loss than patients in control conditions (10.4%). Manzoni et al27demonstrated that both VR and imagination-based relaxation training conditions helpedreduce emotional eating, anxiety,depressive symptoms, and self-efficacy(see Table 2 for scales used). However, ata three-month follow-up, the VR condition—wherein patients wandered inan idyllic mountain landscape—demonstrated greater efficacy in reducing emotional eating than control conditions.Cognitive and motor rehabilitation.In a study by Larson et al,23patients of all ages with traumatic brain injuries (TBI)completed 12 four-minute-long cancellation exercises using a system called Virtual Reality and Robotic Optical Operations Machine (VRROOM[developed by Patton et al38]; See Table2) over a period of two days.23Theauthors observed improvements in memory and attention across trials as measured by target acquisition times.Distractions involving both visual and haptic stimuli were especially effective.Also, in a study by Yin et al,22strokepatients utilized the Sixense VR system(Sixense, Los Gatos, California), are habilitation gaming software consisting of an avatar on a screen that is synchronized with the patient’smovements.22In a virtual environment,users are instructed to pick fruit from ashelf and release it into a basket as manytimes as possible within a two-minutetime frame. The authors observedimproved sensorimotor function for bothVR and non-VR (conventional physicaltherapy) conditions, as measured by theFugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA; see Table2), though no significant differenceswere found between conditions. Patient satisfaction and side effects.Patient satisfaction and side effects aredisplayed in the “SecondaryObservations” column in Table 1.Participants often rated VR sessions asmore fun, more immersive, more useful,and more enjoyable than non-VR conditions.15,20,22Despite previous findings that HMDs or peripheral devices often restrict movement, no such results were found in the present review.28A majority of studies did not report VR side effects, such as motion sicknessor fatigue, as factors negatively influencing patient satisfaction or the efficacy of VR treatments. When asked,patients in the study by Kipping et al17did not report experiencing nausea, and97 percent of patients in the sutdy by Carrougher et al18reported no to mild nausea after using HMDs. Yin et al22found no significant side effects, and deemed VR technology feasible and safefor participants. However, in the Larsonet al23study of 18 patients with TBI,three participants dropped out due to fatigue and eye pain caused by the VRROOM system (Table 2).DISCUSSION In contrast to previous reviews of case reports and observational evidence,the present review focused on controlled studies that describe applications of VR technology in the treatment and rehabilitation of medical inpatients.29,30Data from 11 eligible studies provide insight into three current medical applications of VR technology: pain distraction, eating disorders, and cognitive/motor rehabilitation.Pain distraction.VR is particularly useful as a pain distraction that supplements or replaces traditional pharmacotherapies. According to Wiederhold,7pain perception is dependent on a patient’s capacity to attend to a certain stimulus. Thus, pain management may be achieved byblocking sensory information via opioidanalgesics or by creating a distractionfrom pain by immersing a patient in avirtual environment.11,31Previous studieshave demonstrated that opioidanalgesics may lead to undesirableconsequences, such as nausea,increased length of hospitalizations, andinadequate pain alleviation.32VR presentsa useful alternative with minimal sideeffects, although nausea may bereported from either treatment.Five of seven studies demonstratedthat VR is an efficacious non-pharmacologic adjunct to standard opioid analgesic treatments to reduce pain, distress, and anxiety in adult and pediatric patients undergoing unpleasant medical procedures. Highlighting the psychological components of pain, VR distraction treatments reduce self-reported unpleasantness, time spent thinking about pain, and levels of worst pain experienced.15,17These patient-reported observations are corroborated by neuroimaging studies that have highlighted five brain regions showing reduced activity during VRinterventions—thalamus, insula, primaryand secondary somatosensory cortices,and the anterior cingulate cortex.17Overall, both physiological andpsychological measures suggest that VRis a helpful clinical tool in paindistraction. EDs and obesity.VR is used in eatingdisorders to improve patient body imageexperiences, increase self-efficacy, andpractice healthy decision-making.7Participants may navigate a virtualsupermarket to make healthy foodchoices or they may be encouraged toadopt less harmful perceptions of bodyimage through repeated exposure toimages of diverse body types.1Inconjunction with other psychologicaltherapies (e.g., graded exposure orcognitive-behavioral therapy), patientsdevelop skills that carry over into thereal world. VR therapies are useful not only forreplicating a desired environment, butalso for altering reality (e.g., an avatarthat no longer resembles the patient).9This strategy is consistent with Bem’s(1972) self-perception theory,39which postulates that “individuals developattitudes by observing their own behaviorand concluding what attitudes must havecaused them.” Observing an avatar’sappearance as different from the actualself may shape and change the patients’own attitudes—a phenomenon known asthe Proteus effect.40This strategy hasbeen especially successful in thetreatment of body dysmorphic disorder,binge eating, and anorexia.7As reviewedherein, use of virtual environments, pluslow-calorie diets and exercise, led tosignificant improvements in body imageconcerns, weight loss, and bodysatisfaction while also reducing anxietyand emotional eating.26Additionallongitudinal studies must be conducted inorder to assess the long-term efficacy ofVR interventions in preventing weightgain. Cognitive and motor rehabilitation.VR also presents a novel rehabilitationapproach for patients with strokes,Parkinson’s disease, and brain injuries.7VR training allows for high ecologicalvalidity in a safe and controlledenvironment, provides immediate visualand tactile feedback about the individual’sspecific performance, and may boostmotivation.33–35Experimenter-manipulatedenvironments allow for individualizedtraining to enhance specific skills andneuroplasticity through repeated practice,as well as a means of helping patientsovercome underutilization of limbs.28Theintervention studies reviewed hereinconsisted of repeated safe practice ofparticular skills with the help ofsuperimposed virtual limbs that trainindividuals in tasks specific to theirmedical condition. Inconsistent resultssuggest that further testing of VR in motorand cognitive rehabilitation is required.22,23Limitations.We only included 11controlled trials in medical inpatientpopulations, and did not consider othersuccessful case studies or efficaciousoutpatient interventions. Because of theheterogeneity of this small number ofstudies, we could not conduct a formalmeta-analysis. Additional studies will needto be conducted to assess the efficacy ofVR fully.Future research. Whereas earlystudies of VR utilized costly platformsprecluding widespread use, more recentversions are available at price points thatgreatly improve affordability andaccessibility.36In the present review, twostudies using low-cost off-the-shelfHMD visors did not report significantpain reductions.18,19Future researchshould further examine whether thequality of HMD technology is associatedwith improved efficacy. Future studies of VR in medicalinpatients should utilize larger samplesassessed over time to investigate long-term effects.37Although most VR studiesare found within hospital settings, someclinicians predict VR will be used ashome-based rehabilitation in the future.According to Sandlund, McDonough andHäger-Ross, interactive computer playand VR are especially helpful forphysicallydisabled children who areoften treated at home.29In the hospital setting, VR could beused by patients suffering from chronicpain syndromes (e.g., chronicpancreatitis, back pain, and/or refractorymigraines) or used to reduce pain andanxiety in the emergency department(e.g., for reduction of dislocated joints,suturing of lacerations, cardioversion forarrhythmias, or casting of fractures). VRcould also be used as a distraction forpatients undergoing magnetic resonanceimaging or computed tomographyscanning, during interventionalprocedures or hemodialysis, or as partof chemotherapy infusion protocols.CONCLUSIONOverall, a majority of studies from thepast decade found VR to be efficacious,easy to use, safe, and contributing tohigh patient satisfaction. Studies variedin terms of quality, but we observed norelationship between study quality andkey findings. In most cases, patientsconsidered the VR experience to be fun,immersive, and enjoyable, and fewpatients were lost to attrition due to sideeffects.The use of VR in medical fields isrelatively novel but also promising.37It ishighly interactive, flexible, tailored to theindividual, and applicable to peoplevarying in age, sex, and medicaldisorders. As technology improves andcosts are reduced, VR will undoubtedlyshape the future of healthcare.REFERENCES1.Ferrer-Garcia M, Gutiérrez-MaldonadoJ, Riva G.

Awe is a complex and powerful emotion. It can, for example, make us aware ofthe enormity of existence and our relatively small place in it (Keltner and Haidt, 2003;Saroglouet al., 2008). Despite its profundity, awe has only just begun to receive rigorous empirical attention.According toKeltner and Haidt (2003), awe contains two key dimensions: vastness and the needfor accommodation. Vastness involves the perception of enormous and/or complex stimuli, such asa grand view (perceptual vastness) or a big idea (conceptual vastness). The need for accommodationdescribes  how  awe-inducing  stimuli  force  us  to  adjust  our  cognitive  schemas  to  accommodatethem. This aspect may also imply attentional salience and novelty, therefore, at the cognitive level,the need for accommodation component has been related to surprise (Keltner and Haidt, 2003).Specifically, it could be possible to identify a link between the need for accommodation and specificconcepts of surprise (e.g., astonishment), since they can entail the revision of ourwell-consolidatedbeliefs(Lorini  and  Castelfranchi,  2007)  and  because  both  these  emotions  belong  to  the  familyofknowledge emotions(Silvia, 2010). Moreover, awe can have both a positive and/or a negativevalence,  depending,  in  part,  on  how  the  experience  is  interpreted  (Keltner  and  Haidt,  2003) Despite   this  theoretical   complexity,   most   research  focus   onperceptual  vastness  and  on  positive  experiences  of  awe  (e.g.,Griskevicius   et   al.,   2010;   Campos   et   al.,   2013;   Prade   andSaroglou, 2016), while conceptual vastness, negative experiencesof  awe,  and  the  need  for  accommodation  have  only  rarelybeen   addressed   (Shiota   et   al.,   2007;   Schurtz   et   al.,   2012;Valdesolo  and  Graham,  2014;  Piff  et  al.,  2015).  Importantly,while previous experimental studies constructively induced awein  lab  setting,  they  tended  to  evoke  a  low  intensity  versionof  awe.  In  other  words,  awe  experiences  elicited  in  laboratorysettings   have   tended   to   be   somewhat   subtle   (Silvia   et   al.,2015).Here,  we  suggest  virtual  reality  (VR)  as  an  approach  toelicit   awe   in   more   intense   ways   in   laboratory   settings.   VRis  the  combination  of  stereoscopic  displays,  real-time  motion-tracking,   and   stereo   headphones   as   well   as   other   possiblesensory  simulations  (e.g.,  haptic,  olfactory)  to  create  simulatedenvironments.    Thanks   to   its    ability   to   generate    realisticsimulations of real-world experiences, VR has shown effective asmood-induction  procedure  to  elicit  different  types  of  emotions(Riva  et  al.,  2007,  2016b;  Gorini  et  al.,  2011;  Diemer  et  al.,2015).  After  reviewing  these  preliminary  experimental  studies,we argue that VR provides three key assets for improving awe.First, VR provides users with immersive, realistic, and interactiveenvironments  that  can  elicit  a  sense  of  “presence,”  that  is,  thesubjective experience of “being there” while in a simulated reality(Riva  et  al.,  2011;  Waterworth  et  al.,  2015).  Second,  VR  canbe  used  to  generate  complex  vast  stimuli,  which  can  targetspecific facets of awe (Shiota et al., 2007). Third, VR can be usedto  conveniently  track  behavioral  and  physiological  responses,allowing  an integrated  assessment  of the  emotional  experience.We conclude by discussing the potential challenges related to theimplementation of the proposed strategy.RESEARCH ON AWEAwe  is  a  complex  emotion  arising  from  the  perception  of  andneed to accommodate vastness (Keltner and Haidt, 2003; Shiotaet al., 2007), and which is able to impact on several psychologicalsystems.  Thus  far,  awe  has  begun  to  accrue  a  small  researchliterature  investigating  its  aspects.  For  example,  it  has  beenshown that the experience of awe can foster prosocial attitudesas  measured  by  the  percentage  of  money  participants  allocateto others in distribution tasks (Prade and Saroglou, 2016). Awecan  also  influence  beliefs.  Participants  in  one  study  were  morelikely  to  endorse  spiritual-type  beliefs  after  feeling  awe  (VanCappellen  and  Saroglou,  2012).  Awe  also  influences  well-beingand  physical  health  (Krause  and  Hayward,  2015;  Stellar  et  al.,2015). Furthermore, as an epistemological emotion (Keltner andShiota, 2003; Shiota et al., 2007), awe can change people’s generalperspectives toward the world and themselves (Schneider, 2009).Awe  also  has  been  shown  to  effect  the  detection  of  agency(Valdesolo  and  Graham,  2014).  One  study  has  found  that  theexperience of awe changes one’s sense of time (Rudd et al., 2012).Finally,  other  studies  have  explored  awe’s  phenomenologicaldimensions,  identifying  themes  such  as  “fear,”  “connectedness,”“existential awareness,” and “numinous” (Bonner and Friedman,2011; Gallagher et al., 2015).Most   empirical   studies   have   explicitly   referred   to   thetheoretical  model  developed  by  Keltner  and  Haidt  (2003).  Theflexibility of valence in awe is somewhat unusual for an emotion,though there are other examples that follow this pattern, such asnostalgia (Wildschut et al., 2006). Since conventional models ofemotions typically do not admit this degree of complexity (Trnkaet  al.,  2016),  Keltner  and  Haidt  (2003)  suggested  the  existenceof different emotional themes (i.e., threat, beauty, virtue, power,and uncanny) that “flavor” awe (Keltner and Haidt, 2003; p. 304),creating  a  kind  of  family  of  awe-related  states.  For  example,awe arising from threatening stimuli can be a source of negativevalence, as they write, “danger causes an experience of awe to beflavored  by  feelings  of  fear”  (Keltner  and  Haidt,  2003;  p.  304).Finally, supernatural or sublime stimuli, such as an experience ofGod, can flavor awe with a negative or positive component, suchas fear or love (Keltner and Haidt, 2003).Qualitative   research   has   also   been   conducted   on   awe.Thisresearchmainlyreliesoninterviewsinvestigatingphenomenological  aspects  of  awe.  These  studies  have  generallyfound    evidence    for    profound,    intense,    self-altering,    andoccasionally   transformative   capacities   of   awe   (Bonner   andFriedman, 2011; Gallagher et al., 2015).Despite these complexities of awe, experimental research hastended  to  focus  on  only  a  few  parts  of  this  theoretical  model.Indeed,  the  negative  side  of  awe  has  been  explored  by  fewresearches  (e.g.,  Shiota  et  al.,  2007;  Piff  et  al.,  2015).  Further,the  need  for  accommodation  component  has  only  rarely  beeninvestigated,  maybe  due  to  difficulties  in  its  operationalization.Indeed,   Keltner   and   Haidt   themselves   struggled   to   providean   example   of   the   need   for   accommodation   dimension,   assuggested   by   Sundararajan   (2002).   While   few   studies   haveexplored this dimension experimentally a few exploratory studiesoffer promising new directions. For instance, Schurtz et al. (2012)investigated  need  for  accommodation  by  asking  participantsto   remember   a   moment   of   awe   in   their   lives   and   thenmeasuring  different  aspects  of  awe.  They  found  that  the  needfor  accommodation  dimension  did  not  predict  the  occurrenceof  awe  among  participants.  Other  studies  investigated  the  roleof  personality  factors  related  to  the  need  for  accommodation,showing   the   predictive   role   of   Openness   to   Experience   onthe   tendency   to   experience   awe   (Silvia   et   al.,   2015),   theinverse  relationship  between  dispositional  awe  and  the  Needfor  Cognitive  Closure  (Shiota  et  al.,  2007),  and  the  positiverelationship between the amount of awe experimentally inducedand  a  reduced  ability  to  deal  with  uncertainty  (Valdesolo  andGraham, 2014).Negative awe experiences have been shown to be less frequentthan  positive  ones  (Shiota  et  al.,  2007;  Bonner  and  Friedman,2011),  but  this  does  not  justify  the  reduced  research  attentionto the negative dimension of awe (Bonner and Friedman, 2011).On the contrary, recently, some positive psychology researchersexplicitly characterized awe as a Positive Emotion (Griskeviciuset  al.,  2010;  Shiota  et  al.,  2011;  Van  Cappellen  and  Saroglou,2012;  Campos  et  al.,  2013;  Prade  and  Saroglou,  2016).  Mostexperimental  studies  have  considered  awe  according  to  this characterization, which has proliferated in recent years (Bonnerand  Friedman,  2011).  The  negative  dimension  of  awe  needsfurther elucidation.In  sum,  while  awe  is  beginning  to  accrue  a  small  researchliterature,  certain   aspects  of  awe  detailed  in   the  theoreticalliterature  have  been  underexplored.  In  particular,  research  hastended  to:  (i)  emphasize  vastness  rather  than  the  need  foraccommodation;   (ii)   focus   on   positive   rather   than   negativeawe  experiences;  and  (iii)  rely  on  relatively  low-intensity  aweexperiences.  While  the  first  two  issues  need  to  be  addressed  attheoretical level, we contend that VR could provide an effectivesolution  to  address  the  third  challenge,  that  is,  how  to  inducemore intense and ecologically valid awe experiences. Silvia et al.(2015)  argued  that  intense  experiences  of  awe  have  not  beeninduced in laboratory settings, writing that awe experiences seem“too  rare  and  eccentric  to  be  captured  in  the  lab”  (p.  382).These authors called for an integration of different methods anddisciplines that have studied awe, in order to “place the findingsfrom   low-intensity   and   small-scale   lab   research   in   context”(p.382).USING VIRTUAL REALITY TO STUDYAWEA  recent  comprehensive  work  on  existing  literature  on  VRand   personal   change,   reported   the   effective   use   of   VR   inseveral  domains,  such  as  addictions,  anxiety  disorders,  stressrelated   disorders,   depression,   eating   disorders,   and   moodinduction (Riva et al., 2016b). Regarding the latter aspect, virtualexperiences  can  really  influence  our  inner  world,  such  as  theemotional  one  (Dobricki  and  Pauli,  2016).  In  details,  VR  hasbeen  used  to  to  elicit  both  positive  and  negative  emotions.  Forexample,  in  the  study  of  Riva  et  al.  (2007)  participants  wereimmersed  in  three  virtual  parks  designed  to  induce  differentemotional states (i.e., anxiety, relaxation and neutral). Each videowas displayed through a head-mounted device able to track headmovements. Parks shared the same basic structural components(e.g., trees, lamps, band stand) but they differed regarding someother environmental elements such as music, light, and textures.For example, the virtual park intended to evoke sadness was grayand  cloudy,  users  were  alone,  and  sadness-eliciting  music  wasselected  (i.e.,  “Adagio  for  Strings-Choral”  by  Samuel  Barber).The  neutral  virtual  park,  in  contrast,  had  different  music  (i.e.,“Nothing  Spectacular”  by  Michael  Lindh).  For  the  validationphase of each park all participants listened to short history, whichwas different according to the emotional experimental condition(Baños et al., 2004). Findings indicated that virtual stimuli wereable  to  induce  the  expected  emotional  states.  Recently,  thisprocedure  was  replicated  and  further  extended  by  Felnhoferet  al.  (2015)  who  used  five  different  virtual  park  scenarios  toelicit specific affective states. The researchers created virtual parkscenarios  for  joy,  anger,  boredom,  anxiety,  and  sadness,  whichshared the same layout (i.e., non-playing virtual characters; trees;rubbish  bins;  park  benches;  a  pond).  As  these  series  of  studiesdemonstrate, VR allows for the targeted manipulation of certainelements of the environment in order to elicit target emotions.A  first  attempt  to  use  virtual  simulation  to  elicit  awe  wasmade by Reinerman-Jones et al. (2013). These authors analyzedparticipants’ experiences of viewing the earth from a deep spaceperspective – the so called the “Overview Effect” (White, 1987;Yaden  et  al.,  2016)  –  using  a  qualitative  analysis.  In  anotherstudy, Gallagher et al. (2015) induced the Overview Effect usinga mixed reality test environment, in which participants watchedfour  simulations  of  the  earth  or  deep  space  as  if  they  wereastronauts  on  the  International  Space  Station.  Results  of  thisexperiment  showed  that  VR,  along  with  traditional  methods,such  as  autobiographical  recall,  videos,  and  narratives  can  beused together to induce awe experiences. This provides an initial,exploratory study, which we believe can be usefully built upon. Inparticular, we argue that VR presents the following assets for theinvestigation of awe.VR Enhances Presence and EcologicalValidityVirtual reality is a technological system that combines sensorialdisplays  (i.e.,  visual,  auditory)  with  tracking  devices  that  sensethe movements of the individual and report the collected data tothe  visualization  system,  which  updates  the  scene  in  real  time.VR  allows  researchers  to  create  situations  closer  to  equivalentreal ones, thanks to the pictorial realism and the high resolutionprovided  (Coelho  et  al.,  2006;  Parsons,  2015).  Pictorial  realismis  a  function  of  visual  depth  illusion,  which  is  better  providedby 3D virtual environments than by 2D videos on flat computerscreens.  Furthermore,  VR  supports  more  intense  involvementby  users.  The  sensorial  richness  provided  by  VR  describes  thenumber of sensorial channels involved during virtual experiences(Steuer,  1992;  Coelho  et  al.,  2006).  Also,  the  isolation  offeredby  some  VR  devices  can  provide  an  extremely  vivid  sense  ofpresence in the virtual environment (Riva and Mantovani, 2012,2014;  Waterworth  et  al.,  2015).  In  practical  terms,  presenceallows   researchers   to   access   more   reflexive   responses   fromparticipants, as responses are closer to those produced by real-world circumstances, as opposed to those produced by watchinga  video  on  a  screen.  Finally,  Gorini  et  al.  (2011)  showed  thatproviding  a  narrative  with  VR  involving  long-term  goals  andan  engaging  stroyline  promoted  a  fuller  sense  of  immersionin  virtual  environments.  This  narrative  component  is  anotherrelevant  feature  of  VR  to  elicit  stronger  and  more  meaningfulexperiences (Triberti and Riva, 2015).VR allows the Generation of Complexand Vast StimuliAs  mentioned  previously,  complex  and  vast  stimuli  enhanceawe  (Keltner  and  Haidt,  2003;  Shiota  et  al.,  2007).  VR  hasthe  potential  to  generate  such  stimuli  by  delivering  embodiedexperiences that overcome our sense of physics and challenge ourassumptions about the world (Riva, 2016). From a psychologicalstandpoint,  VR  can  be  described  as  an  “embodied  technology”that  is  able  to  manipulate  the  feeling  of  being  and  acting  inthe  world  (Riva,  2009;  Riva  et  al.,  2014).  According  to  theEmbodiment Perspective on cognition, cognitive components ofemotions  are  not  separated  from  the  body,  since  cognition  is derived  from  the  close  relationship  among  body,  environmentand  brain  (Varela  et  al.,  1991;  Thelen  et  al.,  2001;  Beer,  2003).VR, as an embodied medium, allows to manipulate the “cognitivebeing’s   world”   (Colombetti   and   Thompson,   2008;   p.56),   byproviding different perceptual cues to the users and by invitingthe  user  to  build  a  specific  representation  of  the  situation  inwhich she/he is involved. For example, users can experience thevirtual  environment  as  if  it  was  “his/her  surrounding  world”(augmented  embodiment)  or  can  experience  a  synthetic  avatar(user’s  virtual  representation)  as  if  it  was  “his/her  own  body”(synthetic embodiment).For   example,   VR   can   be   used   to   alter   the   perceptualboundaries of the body through the “incarnation” of the subjectin  the  virtual  space  (Riva  and  Mantovani,  2012,  2014).  Forinstance,  participants  could  experiencead  hoc“time  travels”(Friedman et al., 2014). In this case, participants were involvedin  a  moral  dilemma  in  which  they  experienced  a  sequence  ofevents (in this case, the opportunity to stop a gunman from killingothers) in VR from a first person perspective. In the time travelcondition,  people  came  back  to  the  beginning,  and  saw  theirpast  selves’  with  the  possibility  to  change  events.  This  illusionis based on altering participants’ accustomed frames of temporalreference, resulting in an impact on individuals’ moral judgmenton themselves, as well as influencing their actions and choices tosolve the moral dilemma.A   further   example   is   related   to   the   use   of   VR   for   themanipulation ofbodily self-consciousness, that is, the replacementof the bodily self-consciousness with a synthetic one (Riva, 2016).In this approach, VR is used for creating synthetic avatar (user’svirtual  representation)  experienced  by  the  user  as  if  it  werehis/her  own  body.  To  achieve  synthetic  embodiment,  a  space-temporal correspondence between the multisensory signals andsensory  feedback  experienced  by  the  user,  and  the  visual  datarelated  to  the  avatar,  are  required.  For  instance,  Serino  et  al.(2016) invited individuals to embody a skinny virtual body, andfound a decreased estimation of difference between their virtualavatar and their actual body. In other words, people thought theywere thinner after having a virtual experience of being thin.Researchers  can  create  experimental  VR  paradigms  from  anumber  of  unusual  first-person  perspectives  (Rosenberg  et  al.,2013).  In  one  experiment  conducted  by  Osimo  et  al.  (2015),participants switched between a virtual body closely resemblingthemselves  where  they  described  a  personal  problem,  and  avirtual   body   representing   Dr   Sigmund   Freud,   from   whichthey  offered  themselves  counseling.  These  researchers  reportthat  when  the  counselor  resembled  Freud,  participants’  moodimproved  compared  to  when  the  virtual  counselor  was  a  self-representation.  In  this  regard,  VR  could  be  considered  as  asource  of  “epistemic  expansion”  in  the  sense  that  it  providesthe  possibility  of  experiencing  events  that  would  be  otherwiseinaccessible (Gaggioli, 2016).VR as an Integrated Measurement ToolVirtual    reality    can    provide    two    main    ways    of    trackingthe  users’  emotional  awe  responses,  at  both  behavioral  andphysiological  level.  Using  VR,  it  is  possible  to  measure  users’behavior  in  real  time  during  the  experience,  using  motion-tracking  device  systems.  These  devices  allow  tracking  of  head-movements,  upper-limb  and  hands  and  facial-movements,  aswell  as  measuring  posture.  This  information  could  be  used  toanalyze,  for  example,  non-verbal  displays  of  awe.  Further,  VRoffers  the  potential  to  monitor  psychophysiological  correlatesof   awe,   for   example   measuring   Skin   Conductance,   HeartRate,  Skin  Temperature,  and  Respiration,  while  the  participantis   exposed   to   awe   inducing   stimuli,   delivered   through   theimmersive  medium.  More  importantly,  VR  allows  integratingthese behavioral and psychophysiological measurement with theself-reported descriptions of the experience in an ecological butcontrolled  setting  (Wiederhold  and  Rizzo,  2005;  Parsons,  2015:Fusaro  et  al.,  2016).  For  example,  dynamic  stimuli  could  beconveyed to participants trough VR immersive displays, and theirpsychophysiological reactions, as well as their facial movements,or postural ones, could be concurrently assessed and integrated tobuild a more comprehensive model of the emotional experience.POSSIBLE ISSUES CONCERNING THEUSE OF VIRTUAL REALITY IN AWERESEARCHWhile  the  use  of  VR  to  elicit  awe  can  be  promising,  there  areseveral warnings and guidelines that researchers should keep inmind.  The  aspects  of  VR  that  effectively  raise  the  intensity  ofawe  experiences  also  increase  the  risk  of  a  negative  reaction  inparticipants.First,  as  a  note  to  interested  researchers,  some  VR  set-upscan be needlessly expensive. Reinerman-Jones et al. (2013) useda  mixed  reality  simulation  as  a  new  tool  to  investigate  thephenomenological emergent features of awe experience. Indeed,they  were  also  able  to  grasp  an  element  of  surprise,  closer  tothe  need  for  accommodation  component  of  awe  as  well  as  anegatively valenced awe experience by creating a highly ecologicalexperience of awe (Gallagher, 2013). This study provides supportfor  our  argument  (though  they  did  not  quantitatively  measureawe),   nevertheless,   they   adopted   a   very   expensive   solution.However,  new  mobile  affordable  inexpensive  VR  solutions  arebecoming more widely available, as Samsung Gear VR, GoogleCardboard,  and  HTC  Vive.  Second,  VR  can  also  cause  motionsickness.  From  the  user  side,  the  eventual  mismatch  betweenvisual and vestibular information (Reason and Brand, 1975), canbe a source of complaint, and researchers should be aware of itin order to intervene immediately and adequately. The likelihoodof suffering from this kind of disorientation increases if peopleare requested to “walk” into the virtual environment or to standup  for  long  periods  of  time.  Therefore,  VR  should  be  used  forrelatively short periods of time and include a debriefing session,especially if negative emotions were a target.Lastly,    participants    should    receive    adequate    informedconsent   information,   particularly   if   an   emotionally   intensevirtualenvironmentwillbeused.Forexample,somevirtual   environments   intended   to   induce   a   negative   aweexperience   may   become   terrifying   for   some   participants,promptinganadversereaction,insomecasesmaybe  requiring debriefing or even a referral to a psychotherapist. It isimperative  that  participants  are  aware  of  the  kind  and  level  ofintensity of the experience they will undergo.CONCLUSIONAwe  is  a  profound  and  complex  emotion,  which  can  changepeoples’ lives. It can be considered as the core of transformativeand enduring change (Gaggioli, 2016), even though this potentialhas  not  been  fully  explored  in  experimental  research.  Indeed,experimental  research  on  awe  has  constructively  manipulatedawe,  but  awe  inductions  in  laboratory  settings  have  tended  tobe  quite  subtle,  producing  low  intensity  instance  of  awe.  Weproposed VR as one possible solution to disclose awe potential.Several studies support the potential of VR as a transformativetechnology,  able  to  induce  a  personal  change  (Ferrer-Garciaet  al.,  2013;  Garrett  et  al.,  2014;  Den  Brok  and  Sterkenburg,2015;  Riva  et  al.,  2016b).  VR  allows  simulating  both  our  outerand  inner  world  (Riva  et  al.,  2016b),  by  enhancing  individuals’focus on themselves, thus recreating both external and internalcorrelates  of  our  experience,  but  preserving  highest  levels  ofexperimental control and ecological validity. Furthermore, withVR  it  is  possible  to  reproduce  complex  and  vast  stimuli  at  thebase  of  awe  emergence.  Moreover,  VR  allows  for  a  multi-levelassessment of awe that could be useful to catch more awe nuances.Finally,  if  safety  and  effectiveness  recommendations  regardingthis experimental tool are respected, we believe VR can play animportant role in the study of awe as well as other emotions.AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSAuthors   contributed   according   to   their   competences   andinterests.

IntroductionThe proliferation of available virtual reality (VR) tools hasseen increased use in experimental psychology settings overthe last twenty years [1–4]. For the researcher, VR is com-pelling due to the almost limitless possibilities for the creationof stimuli and this has led to spread of VR into domainssuch as clinical and developmental psychology, which onemight not have initially anticipated [5–7]. Once consideredto be an “answer without a question,” VR is now firmlyestablished as an experimental tool [8]. However, in additionto the many advantages associated with the use of VR, thereremain some drawbacks and ongoing questions. Of course,the relative importance of these issues is dependent entirelyon the use case; while presence may be important in aclinical setting, for example, issues with space perceptionmaylimittheaccuracyofaphysicalreachtask.Similarly,inthe experimental examination of visual perception, potentialdifferences between actual and virtual reality can either beadvantageous or detrimental. In this paper we provide a briefoverview of the benefits and challenges associated with VR inpsychology research and discuss its utility in relation to theexamination of visual perception.The term VR is often used interchangeably to refer toone of three types of system: a virtual environment presentedon a flat screen, a room-based system such as a CAVE, orahead-mounteddisplay(HMD:[9,10]). Though all threesystems are quite different, a common feature of all threeis the introduction of stereoscopic depth, which creates theillusion that the viewer is seeing objects in a virtual space[11]. This offers a number of immediate advantages to theresearcher: greater control over stimulus presentation, varietyin response options, and potentially increased ecologicalvalidity [12]. This has led to increased use of VR as aresearch tool across many psychological domains such aspsychotherapy [13,14], sports psychology [15], and socialinteraction [16].The most apparent advantage of VR is the ability topresent stimuli in three dimensions. This offers specificbenefits depending on the research domain. For example,when discussing the potential application of VR to neu-ropsychological research, Rizzo et al. [17] describe virtualenvironments as “the ultimate Skinner box,” able to presenta range of complex stimulus conditions that would notbe easily controllable in the real world and enabling theexamination of both cognitive processes (e.g., attention) and functional behaviours (e.g., planning and initiating aseries of required actions). In clinical research VR is usedto create complex scenarios, such as simulating exposureto a phobic stimulus, where the form and frequency of theexposure can be manipulated with absolute precision [4].These examples highlight the difference between VR stimuluspresentation and traditional experimental procedures: in VRthe participant responds to pertinent stimuli while immersedin a larger virtual environment which can itself be controlled.This differs from traditional experimental contexts wherethe pertinent stimuli may be controlled but the surroundingenvironment often cannot be.Ofcourse,ifVRwereonlyavisualmedium,thenitcouldbe argued that its only advantage over traditional experi-mental protocols is the ability to present visual stimuli alonga third dimensional plane. However, as VR technology hasadvanced, many VR research studies now include varying lev-els and combinations of multimodal sensory input, allowingaudio, haptic, olfactory, and motion to be experienced simul-taneously to the graphically rendered environment or objects[18–20].Thisgreatlyincreasestheuser’ssenseofimmersionin the virtual environment and allows the experimenter tocreate protocols that would not otherwise be possible. Forexample, exposure therapy is a common method employed inthe treatment of anxiety disorders which, in the case of PTSD,may be difficult to implement for logistical or safety reasons.To overcome these issues, multimodal VR has been employedto create a virtual replica of a warzone, complete with audioand haptic feedback, to treat PTSD in war veterans [21,22].Where phenomena are known to occur due to a confluence ofsensory data (e.g., audio and visual), multimodal VR enablesthe researcher to manipulate each input separately to gaina more accurate understanding of the relative contributionof each. For example, a recent study by Keshavarz et al. [23]employed this technique to assess the effects of auditory andvisualcuesontheperceptionofvectionandresultantmotionsickness in participants. Finally, multimodal environmentsare associated with faster mental processing times of discretestimulus events, potentially because they provide the userwith more complete information about the environment [24].In addition to the presentation of experimental stimuli,VR enabled researchers to develop new protocols to measureparticipant responding. Many researchers have no doubtlamented the situation where studies that aim to assess acomplex psychological construct (e.g., attention) have, out ofnecessity, been reduced to a mere “point and click” exercisefor the participant. Most experiments strike a difficult balancebetween control and ecological validity, and very few replicatethe multifaceted nature of real-life human responding [25].It has been suggested that VR environments might helpbridge this gap by allowing participants to respond in amanner that is more natural [26]. This can be seen acrossa range of psychological topics. For example, studies onaltruism or prosocial behaviour are often carried out usinghypothetical scenarios and self-report responses [27]. Kozlovand Johansen [2] on the other hand, employed a novelapproach to examining this topic using VR. As participantsattempted to navigate out of a virtual maze, under timepressure, virtual avatars approached the participant for helpin a variety of situations. This enabled the experimenters tomeasure actual helping behaviours, as opposed to partici-pants reporting what they would hypothetically do in such asituation. The researchers argue that even sophisticated high-level behaviours can be successfully examined using VR andsuggest wider adoption. VR environments have also beenused recently to examine the avoidance behaviour, a centralcomponentoffearthatcontributestothemaintenanceofanxiety disorders. While many studies have examined thephysiological and self-report aspects of fear, few have beenable to examine the associated avoidance of, for example,the context or environment that elicits the fear response[28]. Glotzbach et al. [29] were able to directly examineavoidance behaviour by conditioning participants to be afraidof particular virtual environments and recording the extent towhich they avoided returning to those environments later inthe study. Finally, VR could be useful to measure responsesin circumstances where it might be impractical or ethicallyquestionable to do so in real life. For example, Renaud etal. [30] used a virtual environment and avatars to examinesexual affordances of convicted child molesters. The VR setupallowed the researchers to identify specific patterns of gazebehaviour exhibited by the experimental and not the controlgroup of participants. They discuss a number of theoreticaldiscussions that emerged from the study by virtue of the“first-person stance” enabled by using VR.2. Questions about the Use of VRin Psychology ResearchSince many of the advantages of VR as an experimentaltool are derived from the ability to place the participantinside the scene, it is not surprising that a lot of researchhas been conducted into the concept of presence—the extentto which the user feels as though they are “really there”[31,32]. Presence is viewed as crucial to having participantsrespondthesamewayinVRastheywouldinrealitybutremains a difficult concept to measure objectively [32–34].Many studies have recorded user’s subjective experience ofpresence and the perceived effect it has on engagement withtasks in a virtual environment [35–38]. Kober and Neuper[39] attempted to measure presence objectively and posit thatit is characterised by increased attention toward stimuli in thevirtual environment and correspondingly lower attention toVR irrelevant stimuli. They were able to identify distinct ERPpatterns associated with increased presence. Furthermore,[32] found differences in the levels of presence elicited by adesktop VR system and a more immersive single-wall VRsystem, which was characterised by stronger activation offrontal and parietal brain regions, measured using EEG.One of the determinants of presence is the level of immer-sion, described as the level of sensory fidelity offered by theVR system [40]. It has many contributing components suchas field of view, field of regard, display size, and stereoscopy(not exhaustive) and although many use the terms presenceand immersion interchangeably (e.g., [41]), they are verydifferent concepts [31]. Immersion is an objective descriptionof the technical capabilities of the VR system that describesthe level of detail with which a virtual environment can be rendered, while presence describes the user’s psychologicalresponse to said environment. Different users can experiencedifferent levels of presence in environment with the samelevel of immersion, depending on a range of factors suchas state of mind. Still, it seems intuitive that a researcherwould want higher levels of immersion wherever possible, asa higher-fidelity virtual world would elicit more generalizableresponses. Indeed, immersive environments seem to bebetter remembered by participants [37], elicit more intenseemotional responses [42], increase collaboration [43], andmore successfully replicate the anxiety associated with real-life stressful situations [44].Atthesametime,creatinganenvironment elicits a sense of presence that is not entirelydependent on immersion. Factors such as personality andemotional state also influence presence [45–47]. In a researchcontext, realism might not be determined by visual fidelitybut by psychological fidelity: the extent to which stimuluspresentation evokes the type of physiological or emotionalresponse one would experience in real life. While immersionmight help with this goal, it is not the only determining factor[3].Indeed, it is not universally accepted that higher immer-sion is always better with some researchers reporting physicaland psychological side effects from exposure to VR. These arecollectively referred to as virtual reality-induced side effects(VRISE [48]) and often focus on a general feeling of malaiseor perhaps motion sickness experienced by users [49]. Theeffect was initially believed to be caused by limitations in earlyVR technologies where there was often a lag between partic-ipant movements and the display being updated resulting ina disconnection between the perceptual and motor systemsof the user [50]. However, while technological advances haveovercome this early limitation, VRISE remain a problem[23,51,52]. Although common in most VR users, these sideeffects vary from person to person and, as such, it is difficultto pin down what aspects of immersion are responsible.While some studies suggest that more immersive HMDs arelinked to higher levels of sickness in participants [53], otherssuggest that there is little difference between the side effectsof using standard desktop computer display and a head-mounted VR display [54]. Regardless, it seems that thesesymptoms are generally mild and quick to subside and thereis some evidence that users can adapt with repeated exposure[1,55–57]. While not all that common in the literature,researchers should also consider potential psychological sideeffects of VR use, depending on the topic being examined. Forexample, Aardema et al. [58]foundthatuserswhohadbeenexposed to an immersive virtual environment demonstratedincrease in dissociative experience including a lessened senseof presence in objective reality as the result of exposure toVR, while Aim ́eetal.[59] found that VR immersion ledto body dissatisfaction amongst users. As VR environmentsbecome more realistic and scenarios potentially more com-plex, another potential confound may arise from what Yeeand Bailenson [60] term the Proteus effect, where users in aVR environment change their behaviour depending on howthey are represented in the virtual world, though currentlythis effect seems limited to studies that use third-person viewand avatars, as opposed to first person perspective [61].3. The Use of VR in VisualPerception ResearchIn many domains, the benefits of VR stem from the abilityto create recognisable, three-dimensional facsimiles of realobjects in space. As a simplified example, let us imagine astudy that asks participants to attend to the environment andrespondeverytimetheyseeapersonwithahappyface.Herethe researcher needs only the object (face) to be presented, tobe recognised by the participant, and to measure some levelof reaction on the part of the participant. In such a context,the main technical focus in relation to VR is likely to be thevisual fidelity of the stimuli—the extent to which the facescan be detailed enough for participants to distinguish theirex<x>pressions. In the experimental study of visual perception,however, the researcher is concerned with how the stimuli areperceived. Here, VR offers both advantages and drawbackswhen compared with real life and traditional experimentalapparatus. In the following section, we focus on interestingaspects of immersive VR environments that impact how weexamine perception: (1) space and movement and (2) tightercontrol over the visual scene.3.1.TheEffectofSpaceandMovementinVRonPerception.One area where complications arise is in the perception ofspace [62]. Many studies have observed a disparity betweenjudgements of distance and perceptual actions such as reach-ing [63,64]. In addition, it has been found that in VR,users consistently underestimate the size of the environmentanddistancetoobjects[65]. Although not always replicated(e.g., [66]),thiseffecthasbeenfoundtobeconsistentwithbinocular and monocular vision [67], with varying field ofview [68] and even when providing motion parallax andstereoscopic depth cues to the observer [69]. Bingham et al.[62] provide a useful explanation: what we see in VR as anobjectisactuallyaseriesofimagesmediatedbyadisplay.While the user’s vision is focused on the series of imagesthat make up the virtual object, the object itself appears ina different location. As a result, when the user is viewingthe object, there is disconnect between accommodation (thefixed viewing distance between the user and the display) andconvergence(theuser’seyesconvergingonthevirtualobject),two processes that are inextricably linked in viewing objectsin actual reality. Some studies have suggested that this effectis an issue of perception-action recalibration, while otherssuggest that walking through the virtual environment withcontinuous visual feedback is necessary to cause rescaling ofthe perceived space [70].On the other hand, there are instances where the discon-nection between virtual and actual reality provides oppor-tunities for the examination of perception, which wouldotherwise not be possible. Mast and Oman [71]usedavirtual environment to examine visual reorientation illusions,a phenomenon reported by astronauts where the perceivedidentity of a surface is changed due to rotation of the entirevisual field. This phenomenon is difficult to replicate in reallife, as we are surrounded by visual cues in our environmentthat help us to orient ourselves (e.g., trees grow upwards),as well as the orienting force of gravity, which provides a consistent cue for “down.” The authors created an immersiveenvironment (i.e., a room containing various objects) withintentionally ambiguous visual cues so that, due to theplacement of objects in the room, it could appear correctlyoriented even if the room were rotated by 90∘.Theresearcherswere then able to rotate the entire visual scene and examinetheeffectsonperception—somethingthatwouldbealmostimpossible to replicate in the physical environment.In addition to creating new illusions, an immersiveenvironment offers the possibility to examine commonlyemployed visual illusions in new contexts. Traditionally,illusions to examine perception are designed and employedassuming a stationary point of view and have not beenstudied thoroughly for a moving observer. By employing animmersive environment it is possible to investigate whetherthese illusions persist when the observer moves. This wouldbe difficult to carry out using a two-dimensional computerscreen setup, due to the fact that the stimuli, and hence theillusion, require the observer to view the screen head on.Bruder et al. [72] introduced the use of VR to investigate howvisual motion illusions are perceived for a moving observer.The authors manipulated the optical flow—the change ofthe light pattern on the observer’s eyes when moving in theenvironment—and found that optic flow manipulation cansignificantly affect users’ self-motion judgments.Movement can also add ecological validity to the exam-ination of everyday perceptual phenomena. Change blind-ness, a phenomenon in which changes occurring in a visualscene are not noticed by the observer, occurs in a variety ofcontextsanditsimpactisstudiedinrangeofappliedsettingsfrom courtroom eye-witness testimony to driving behaviour[73,74]. Experimental examinations of the effect are usuallydone on a computer screen where two similar images arepresented one after the other with a short blanking betweenthetwo,andobservershavetoindicatewhetherthesecondimage is the same as the first one or if a change has occurred[75]. Using VR to create a more ecologically valid examina-tion of the phenomenon, Suma et al. [76] had the observerwalk through an immersive virtual environment and foundthat even large changes in the surrounding environment wereunlikely to be noticed.3.2. Control over the Visual Scene.Virtual reality technol-ogyovercomesanumberofthelimitationsoftraditionalexperimental methods by enabling precise control of thespatialdistributionofthelightinthevisualsceneaswellasdistance and position of stimuli. In a real room, it is not pos-sible to manipulate these elements completely independently.However, with virtual reality it is possible to manipulate thedistances between the surfaces whilst at the same time main-taining the same photometric relationships (i.e., the amountof light reaching the observers’ eyes remained constant).Furthermore, by manipulating objects in three-dimensionalspace, it is possible to examine the effects of positive andnegative parallax which would not be possible using a two-dimensional screen. Moreover, the VR technology allows fullcontrol of the amount of light reaching the observers’ eyes andof the spatial arrangement of the surfaces in the visual scene.Thislevelofcontrolisparticularlyusefulwhenweexamine colour perception and particular visual phenom-ena such as colour contrast phenomenon [77]. The colourcontrast phenomenon refers to the condition whereby twosurfaceswiththesamespectralcompositionareperceivedtohave a different colour when they are placed against differentchromatic backgrounds. It has been shown that this phe-nomenon depends on perceptual belongingness, the group-ing of a set of apparent elements into a perceived whole [78,79].AsGilchristetal.[80] explained, “When the [contrast]display is presented in a textbook, it is perceived to belong tothe page of the book and to the table on which the book islying. Thus, [...] the illusion should be quite weak” (p. 814).Adopting a VR technology prevents surfaces from outsideof the experimental display from affecting the experimentalexamination of the colour contrast phenomenon. Althoughthe contrast phenomenon has been a focus of centuries ofdebate that has interested scientists and philosophers sinceAristotle’s time [81], there is still no shared consensus of whyit actually happens as some authors attribute its occurrence tohigh-level factors of the visual process whilst others claim thatthe phenomenon is due to low-level factors. In an attempt todisentangle these viewpoints, Soranzo et al. [82]studiedthisphenomenon in VR and provided evidence that the colourcontrast phenomenon may be attributed to the summativeeffect of factors occurring to both high- and low-level factorsof the visual process.4. ConclusionsThe proliferation of available virtual reality (VR) tools hasseen increased use in experimental psychology settings overthe last twenty years. In this review, we outlined the advan-tages and disadvantages of this technology in psychologicalresearch, compared to more traditional apparatus. The advan-tages of VR are that it allows greater control over stimuluspresentation; variety in response options; presentation ofstimuli in three dimensions; the creation of complex sce-narios; the generation of varying levels and combinations ofmultimodal sensory input potentially allowing audio, haptic,olfactory, and motion to be experienced simultaneouslyto the graphically rendered environment or objects; thepossibility for participants to respond in a more ecologicallyvalid manner; the precise and independent manipulationof the geometric and photometric relationships betweenobjects; the possibility of examining sophisticated complexparticipants behaviours, such as avoidance; and the study ofsituations which can be impractical, dangerous, or ethicallyquestionable to be created in real life.Additionally, we suggest that although this technologyhas enormous potential to facilitate new discoveries in psy-chology, there are certain variables that need to be taken intoaccountbytheresearcherincludingtheconceptofpresence—immersion alone is not necessarily sufficient to make theparticipant feel as if the virtual objects are “really there” andrespond accordingly; physical and psychological side effectsfrom exposure to VR (virtual reality-induced side effects). Inaddition, we considered issues that emerge from use of VR inthe examination of visual perception and how comparative ifferences in the perception of colour, contrast, space, andmovement, when compared to real life, can be a concern if thegoal is exact replication of perception in the physical world oran advantage when trying to create “impossible scenarios.”Finally, it is worth noting that there are large variationsin the size and cost of the various apparatus and in somecases they can be impractical for some settings due to theirtechnological complexities. Until quite recently, the priceof immersive HMDs with a good tracker system could beprohibitive. However, HMDs are now becoming cheaperand easier to obtain [83,84], while virtual reality caves, forexample, are still comparatively more expensive and requirea large amount of space to install [9,85]. Nevertheless, VRoffers exciting opportunities and we hope to see future workthat more thoroughly examines the psychometric propertiesof this useful research tool.Conflict of InterestsThe authors declare that there is no conflict of interestsregarding the publication of this paper.References[1] L.

To date, no systematicreview has been conducted on the useof VR in the inpatient medical setting.Herein, we review controlled studies evaluating the utility and efficacy of VR-based treatments for patients admitted to hospitals or rehabilitation centers.VR and its use in healthcare.VR refers to the interactions between an individual and a computer-generated environment stimulating multiple sensory modalities, including visual,auditory, or haptic experiences.9Theuser’s perception of reality is facilitatedby the use of head-mounted displays (HMDs, in goggles or headsets), wall projectors, and/or gloves fitted with sensors or touch-sensitive motors.Sensors may allow researchers to monitor and record a patient’s level ofinteractivity (known as “immersion” or“presence”) in a way that is reliable,safe, and replicable.3VR’s immersive, entertaining effects are useful for redirecting the patient’s attention away from painful treatment experiences and reducing anxiety,discomfort, or unpleasantness.12VR has been utilized in many studies to distract(often pediatric) patients during wound redressing in burn care, and in exposure therapy for phobias or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a substitute for imagination of a feared environment.7VR has been used to treat eating disorders and obesity, allowing patients to improve body image perceptions and promote healthier eating habits by inhabiting realistic avatars in stress-inducing virtual situations, such as food shopping.7VR is also used for patient motor rehabilitation, aiding patients to reacquire specific skills and improve body movement in virtual environments that are less dull or discouraging than standard gym exercises.METHODSLiterature search strategy.Wereviewed all controlled trials of VR ininpatient medical settings published overthe last 10 years. We used PsycINFO,PubMed, and Medline electronicdatabases to identify studies from 2005to 2015, based on the followingkeywords: virtual reality, VR therapy,treatment, and inpatient. We alsoreviewed reference lists of previousreviews and meta-analyses to identifytitles not captured in our initial search.We excluded trials with no control orcomparison group, case studies,outpatient studies, theses ordissertations, and articles not publishedin the English language. As displayed inFigure 1, our initial search yielded 2,024citations of journal articles written inEnglish over the last decade. Wediscarded 1,966 citations not involvinginpatient populations and reviewed theremaining 58 studies in more detail. Weexcluded 42 of these studies because they did not meet all inclusion criteria,were duplicates, or because the full text was not available. We grouped the final11 eligible studies based on their application of VR to three broad medical conditions: pain distraction, eating disorders/obesity, and cognitive/motor rehabilitation. These studies are described in Table 1. Evaluation of study quality.To evaluate the strength of scientific evidence reported in these studies, we utilized a measure developed by Reisch,Tyson, and Mize, chosen among several measures reviewed and approved by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ).13,14We selected the Reisch measure because it can be used for both observational studies and randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) and thoroughly assesses many important domains, including the following: study purpose, experimental design, sample size determination, description and suitability of subjects, randomization and stratification, usage of control/comparison group, treatment procedures, blinding, attrition, subject and treatment evaluation metrics, data analysis and presentation, and treatment recommendations. The measure aggregates data on 34 attributes within these 12 domains to produce a quality ratio (0–1), and can be adjusted to exclude attributes that do not apply to a given study. For example, blinding to the usage of VR is impossible by design, so this domain was not included in our evaluation of study quality.Two raters (study authors JR andMR) scored each VR trial, utilizing a subset of applicable questions that totaled 27 points. After each rater completed a review of one of the VR trials, the raters conferred and discusseddifferences in scoring. Then, each raterreviewed the complete set of articlespresented herein.15We assessed inter-rater reliability by computing Cohen’s Kappa statistic.16Because of theapparent heterogeneity of studies andinconsistency of reported results, weopted not to conduct a meta-analysis.RESULTSOverview.We identified 11 controlledstudies of medical inpatients for thecurrent review, but only eight studiesrandomized patients to VR conditions, orrandomized the order of delivery of VRor standard interventions usingcrossover designs. We observed thatstudies were heterogeneous with regardto targeted disease state, VR equipmentand intervention materials, andoutcomes assessed. Thus, wecategorized results within eachapplication of VR to medical inpatients. Study quality.Studies varied in termsof quality (average quality score=0.87;standard deviation [SD]=0.06;range=0.78–0.96).13The raters were instrong agreement on most study qualitydomains assessed (Cohen’s κ=0.84). Nostudies defined the magnitude of theoutcome to be evaluated (e.g., a 20%drop in pain GRS scores) or explicitlydiscussed cost-effectiveness, althoughfour studies did consider VR devicecost.15,17–19Five of the 11 studies usedsmall samples (i.e., n<30), as expectedin a novel technology efficacy trial.19–23Notably, the lowest rated study(Patterson et al21) and the highest ratedstudy (Schmitt et al15) were authored bymembers of the same study team.15,21Lower quality studies utilized smallersamples, did not randomize participants,and did not consider all factorsassociated with treatment (e.g., cost,adherence, side effects). Higher quality studies conformed to the expectedstructure of an RCT, justified and utilized larger samples, and considered patient side effects. We observed no temporal patterns in study quality, and found no associations between targeted disease state and quality score.Pain distraction.As shown in Table1, VR is used for pain management in inpatient populations more commonly than for other applications. Most researchers utilized the SnowWorld VRsystem (University of Washington HITLab and Harborview Burn Center,Seattle Washington)—the first VR software created for pain control during burn wound redressing—consisting ofan HMD through which patients view and interact with snow-themed characters and throw virtual snow ballsat approaching snowmen via a computer mouse or keyboard.20,24In a first-of-its-kind study of burn victims using SnowWorld, Hoffman et al20observed a41-percent reduction in pain in the VR condition versus a control group, as well a strong negative correlation between self-reported “immersion” in the VR environment and pain ratings. Schmitt etal15observed significant reductions in cognitive pain (time spent thinking about pain, reduced 44%), affective pain(emotional unpleasantness, reduced32%), and sensory pain (reduced 27%),as well as highly positive feelings toward the VR intervention (which many labelledas “fun”). Carrougher et al17alsoobserved reductions in pain unpleasantness (31%), time spent thinking about pain (31%), and worstpain experienced (27%) in VRconditions, but did not observestatistically significant improvements inrange of motion (ROM) physical therapy,which consists of assisted exercisesdesigned to help patients gainmovement in affected body segments(e.g. hand, wrist, elbow, shoulder, knee,or ankle). A study by Patterson et al21assessedthe analgesic efficacy of virtual realityhypnosis (VRH), a new procedure inwhich the hypnotist verbally expressessuggestions that focus the patient’sattention away from pain. Based onscores obtained both immediately afterthe interventions and eight hours later,VRH patients reported lessunpleasantness and less pain intensitythan both control groups (VR withouthypnosis, or standard analgesictreatment alone). Two studies of burn patients utilizinglow-cost, easily accessible andaffordable VR HMD systems (Z8003DVisor, eMagin, New York, New York)and off-the-shelf software computergames did not report significantdifferences in self-reported painmeasures or anxiety (see Table 2 fordetailed descriptions of scales used).Morris et al19compared adult burnpatient exposure to VR (video gamesplus analgesics) to a control condition(analgesics alone) and found amarginally significant difference in painreduction between conditions (p=0.06),but no significant decreases in self-reported anxiety. In the Kipping et alstudy,18patients did not report decreasesin pain during burn wound redressing,but nursing staff observed significantreductions.One study utilized wall projectionsand motion detection instead of HMDsto examine the effectiveness oftherapeutic play for reducing depressivesymptoms in pediatric oncologypatients.25After a week of treatment,children in the experimental groupreported significantly fewer depressivesymptoms than those in the controlgroup, but they did not report significantdifferences in state anxiety. Eating disorders (EDs) and obesity.Two recent studies investigating theefficacy of VR treatment in populationswith EDs are presented in Table 1. Cesaet al26assessed the brief and long-termefficacy of VR plus cognitive-behavioraltherapy in a group of 90 female patientswith obesity at an inpatient rehabilitationclinic. In the VR treatment arm,participants wore HMDs and navigatedthrough 14 different virtualenvironments. Patients were exposed totempting situations (e.g., buying unhealthy food at the supermarket) to improve self-control and motivation, aswell as situations that challenged negative body image (e.g., swimming pool). Although improvements in body satisfaction were reported in all study conditions, only patients in the VR condition reported improved body image perceptions at five-week follow-up. After one year, VR patients were significantly better (44.4%) at improving or maintaining weight loss than patients in control conditions (10.4%). Manzoni et al27demonstrated that both VR and imagination-based relaxation training conditions helpedreduce emotional eating, anxiety,depressive symptoms, and self-efficacy(see Table 2 for scales used). However, ata three-month follow-up, the VR condition—wherein patients wandered inan idyllic mountain landscape—demonstrated greater efficacy in reducing emotional eating than control conditions.Cognitive and motor rehabilitation.In a study by Larson et al,23patients of all ages with traumatic brain injuries (TBI)completed 12 four-minute-long cancellation exercises using a system called Virtual Reality and Robotic Optical Operations Machine (VRROOM[developed by Patton et al38]; See Table2) over a period of two days.23Theauthors observed improvements in memory and attention across trials as measured by target acquisition times.Distractions involving both visual and haptic stimuli were especially effective.Also, in a study by Yin et al,22strokepatients utilized the Sixense VR system(Sixense, Los Gatos, California), are habilitation gaming software consisting of an avatar on a screen that is synchronized with the patient’smovements.22In a virtual environment,users are instructed to pick fruit from ashelf and release it into a basket as manytimes as possible within a two-minutetime frame. The authors observedimproved sensorimotor function for bothVR and non-VR (conventional physicaltherapy) conditions, as measured by theFugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA; see Table2), though no significant differenceswere found between conditions. Patient satisfaction and side effects.Patient satisfaction and side effects aredisplayed in the “SecondaryObservations” column in Table 1.Participants often rated VR sessions asmore fun, more immersive, more useful,and more enjoyable than non-VR conditions.15,20,22Despite previous findings that HMDs or peripheral devices often restrict movement, no such results were found in the present review.28A majority of studies did not report VR side effects, such as motion sicknessor fatigue, as factors negatively influencing patient satisfaction or the efficacy of VR treatments. When asked,patients in the study by Kipping et al17did not report experiencing nausea, and97 percent of patients in the sutdy by Carrougher et al18reported no to mild nausea after using HMDs. Yin et al22found no significant side effects, and deemed VR technology feasible and safefor participants. However, in the Larsonet al23study of 18 patients with TBI,three participants dropped out due to fatigue and eye pain caused by the VRROOM system (Table 2).DISCUSSION In contrast to previous reviews of case reports and observational evidence,the present review focused on controlled studies that describe applications of VR technology in the treatment and rehabilitation of medical inpatients.29,30Data from 11 eligible studies provide insight into three current medical applications of VR technology: pain distraction, eating disorders, and cognitive/motor rehabilitation.Pain distraction.VR is particularly useful as a pain distraction that supplements or replaces traditional pharmacotherapies. According to Wiederhold,7pain perception is dependent on a patient’s capacity to attend to a certain stimulus. Thus, pain management may be achieved byblocking sensory information via opioidanalgesics or by creating a distractionfrom pain by immersing a patient in avirtual environment.11,31Previous studieshave demonstrated that opioidanalgesics may lead to undesirableconsequences, such as nausea,increased length of hospitalizations, andinadequate pain alleviation.32VR presentsa useful alternative with minimal sideeffects, although nausea may bereported from either treatment.Five of seven studies demonstratedthat VR is an efficacious non-pharmacologic adjunct to standard opioid analgesic treatments to reduce pain, distress, and anxiety in adult and pediatric patients undergoing unpleasant medical procedures. Highlighting the psychological components of pain, VR distraction treatments reduce self-reported unpleasantness, time spent thinking about pain, and levels of worst pain experienced.15,17These patient-reported observations are corroborated by neuroimaging studies that have highlighted five brain regions showing reduced activity during VRinterventions—thalamus, insula, primaryand secondary somatosensory cortices,and the anterior cingulate cortex.17Overall, both physiological andpsychological measures suggest that VRis a helpful clinical tool in paindistraction. EDs and obesity.VR is used in eatingdisorders to improve patient body imageexperiences, increase self-efficacy, andpractice healthy decision-making.7Participants may navigate a virtualsupermarket to make healthy foodchoices or they may be encouraged toadopt less harmful perceptions of bodyimage through repeated exposure toimages of diverse body types.1Inconjunction with other psychologicaltherapies (e.g., graded exposure orcognitive-behavioral therapy), patientsdevelop skills that carry over into thereal world. VR therapies are useful not only forreplicating a desired environment, butalso for altering reality (e.g., an avatarthat no longer resembles the patient).9This strategy is consistent with Bem’s(1972) self-perception theory,39which postulates that “individuals developattitudes by observing their own behaviorand concluding what attitudes must havecaused them.” Observing an avatar’sappearance as different from the actualself may shape and change the patients’own attitudes—a phenomenon known asthe Proteus effect.40This strategy hasbeen especially successful in thetreatment of body dysmorphic disorder,binge eating, and anorexia.7As reviewedherein, use of virtual environments, pluslow-calorie diets and exercise, led tosignificant improvements in body imageconcerns, weight loss, and bodysatisfaction while also reducing anxietyand emotional eating.26Additionallongitudinal studies must be conducted inorder to assess the long-term efficacy ofVR interventions in preventing weightgain. Cognitive and motor rehabilitation.VR also presents a novel rehabilitationapproach for patients with strokes,Parkinson’s disease, and brain injuries.7VR training allows for high ecologicalvalidity in a safe and controlledenvironment, provides immediate visualand tactile feedback about the individual’sspecific performance, and may boostmotivation.33–35Experimenter-manipulatedenvironments allow for individualizedtraining to enhance specific skills andneuroplasticity through repeated practice,as well as a means of helping patientsovercome underutilization of limbs.28Theintervention studies reviewed hereinconsisted of repeated safe practice ofparticular skills with the help ofsuperimposed virtual limbs that trainindividuals in tasks specific to theirmedical condition. Inconsistent resultssuggest that further testing of VR in motorand cognitive rehabilitation is required.22,23Limitations.We only included 11controlled trials in medical inpatientpopulations, and did not consider othersuccessful case studies or efficaciousoutpatient interventions. Because of theheterogeneity of this small number ofstudies, we could not conduct a formalmeta-analysis. Additional studies will needto be conducted to assess the efficacy ofVR fully.Future research. Whereas earlystudies of VR utilized costly platformsprecluding widespread use, more recentversions are available at price points thatgreatly improve affordability andaccessibility.36In the present review, twostudies using low-cost off-the-shelfHMD visors did not report significantpain reductions.18,19Future researchshould further examine whether thequality of HMD technology is associatedwith improved efficacy. Future studies of VR in medicalinpatients should utilize larger samplesassessed over time to investigate long-term effects.37Although most VR studiesare found within hospital settings, someclinicians predict VR will be used ashome-based rehabilitation in the future.According to Sandlund, McDonough andHäger-Ross, interactive computer playand VR are especially helpful forphysicallydisabled children who areoften treated at home.29In the hospital setting, VR could beused by patients suffering from chronicpain syndromes (e.g., chronicpancreatitis, back pain, and/or refractorymigraines) or used to reduce pain andanxiety in the emergency department(e.g., for reduction of dislocated joints,suturing of lacerations, cardioversion forarrhythmias, or casting of fractures). VRcould also be used as a distraction forpatients undergoing magnetic resonanceimaging or computed tomographyscanning, during interventionalprocedures or hemodialysis, or as partof chemotherapy infusion protocols.CONCLUSIONOverall, a majority of studies from thepast decade found VR to be efficacious,easy to use, safe, and contributing tohigh patient satisfaction. Studies variedin terms of quality, but we observed norelationship between study quality andkey findings. In most cases, patientsconsidered the VR experience to be fun,immersive, and enjoyable, and fewpatients were lost to attrition due to sideeffects.The use of VR in medical fields isrelatively novel but also promising.37It ishighly interactive, flexible, tailored to theindividual, and applicable to peoplevarying in age, sex, and medicaldisorders. As technology improves andcosts are reduced, VR will undoubtedlyshape the future of healthcare.REFERENCES1.Ferrer-Garcia M, Gutiérrez-MaldonadoJ, Riva G.

In clinical settings and experimental studies, participantsimmersed in VR experience reduced levels of pain, general distress/unpleasantness and report adesire to use VR again during painful medical procedures. Investigators hypothesize that VR actsas a nonpharmacologic form of analgesia by exerting an array of emotional affective, emotion-based cognitive and attentional processes on the body’s intricate pain modulation system. Whilethe exact neurobiological mechanisms behind VR’s action remain unclear, investigations arecurrently underway to examine the complex interplay of cortical activity associated withimmersive VR. Recently, new applications, including VR, have been developed to augmentevidenced-based interventions, such as hypnosis and biofeedback, for the treatment of chronicpain. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature, exploring clinical andexperimental applications of VR for acute and chronic pain management, focusing specifically oncurrent trends and recent developments. In addition, we propose mechanistic theories highlightingVR distraction and neurobiological explanations, and conclude with new directions in VRresearch, implications and clinical significance.Virtual reality (VR) is a state-of-the-art technologically advanced system that allows users tobe transported into a ‘virtual world.’ Users are engaged in a fully immersive VR experiencethrough a combination of technologies, including a head-mounted display (HMD),headphones with sound/music and noise reduction, a rumble pad, joystick or another devicefor manipulation/navigation of the virtual environment (VE). VR also includes head-tracking systems, which are often built into the HMD. These systems follow the user’s headmovements, giving them the illusion of being completely surrounded by a virtual world.Multimodal (visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory) stimuli contribute to a sense of actualpresence/immersion in the virtual world, thus making the VR experience distinct frompassively watching television or movies, or playing a 2D handheld videogame or gameconsole. A variety of VR systems have been developed and investigated from low- to high-tech systems, including nonimmersive 2D VR systems administered without helmets to fully immersive VR systems with multimodal stimuli, resulting in mixed outcome efficacy.Figures 1 & 2 show applications of the VR technology.Originally, VR technology was solely recognized for its entertainment value; however, inthe past 10 years, its application has been expanded to a variety of clinical areas, includingpain management, physical rehabilitation and the treatment of psychiatric disorders (e.g.,phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety disorder) [1–4]. It has been mostfrequently studied in medical settings as a means to attenuate pain perception, anxiety andgeneral distress during painful medical procedures, such as wound care, chemotherapy,dental procedures and routine medical procedures [5–9].To date, few theories have been proposed regarding the pain-attenuating effects of VRbeyond simple distraction. In an attempt to understand the underlying mechanistic origin forVR analgesia, investigators have considered the neurobiological interplay of brain corticesand neurochemistry, as well as emotional, cognitive and attentional processes. While VR hasbeen demonstrated in a variety of settings to effectively decrease pain and distress associatedwith painful procedures, researchers have only recently begun to deconstruct patient anddisease characteristics, specific aspects of VR technology, and to identify neurobiologicalmechanisms underlying VR.Melzack and Wall proposed the Gate Control Theory, which suggests that factors such asthe level of attention paid to the pain, the emotion associated with the pain and pastexperience of the pain all play a role in how the pain will be interpreted [10]. McCaul andMalott expanded this theory to state that human beings have a limited capacity of attentionand an individual must attend to a painful stimulus in order for it to be perceived as painful[11]. Therefore, if the individual is attending to another stimuli away from the noxiousstimuli, they will perceive the painful stimulus as less intense. Wickens proposed theMultiple Resources Theory, which states that resources in different sensory systems functionindependently [12]. This supports the nature of VR technology, which is based onintegrating multimodal (visual, auditory, tactile and olfactory) sensory distractions.Recently, Gold et al. hypothesized that VR analgesia originates from intercorticalmodulation among signaling pathways of the pain matrix through attention, emotion,memory and other senses (e.g., touch, auditory and visual), thereby producing analgesia[13]. An overall decrease of activities in the pain matrix may be accompanied by increasesof activity in the anterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal regions of the brain.While there is substantial research supporting the use of VR for the attenuation of acute painduring medical procedures, the exploration of VR use for chronic pain management is still inits inception. Investigations must be conducted to further understand VR’s role in acute andchronic pain management. Current studies are underway to understand the underlyingmechanisms behind VR’s analgesic effects and to deconstruct the patient (age, gender andpain history), disease and technology (HMD, head tracking and VE) characteristics.Ultimately, understanding the influences and interactions of these independent variables willlead to optimal patient/VR matching, thus, personalizing the interventions to maximize VR’spain-attenuating effects. Hopefully, lessons learned from these early VR investigations willhave applications in chronic pain management and other pain rehabilitative conditions.Ultimately, the aim of current VR investigations is to develop flexible environmentstargeting specific acute and chronic pain conditions, and to promote long-term rehabilitativepain management. VR for acute pain managementBurn careThe use of VR for pain and anxiety attenuation during burn care procedures andrehabilitation of burn survivors is one of the most widely researched uses of VR technology.Clearly, burn wound care causes a tremendous amount of pain, anxiety and discomfort topatients. In 2000, Hoffman et al. reported a case study examining the efficacy of VRcompared with a standard video game for two adolescents (16 and 17 years old) undergoingburn wound care [14]. VR was found to decrease pain levels, anxiety and time spentthinking about pain. Das et al. conducted a randomized control trial, comparing standard ofcare (analgesia) with analgesia plus VR for children (5–18 years old) during burn woundcare [15]. Analgesia coupled with VR was more effective in reducing pain and distress thananalgesia alone. More recently, a water-friendly VR system was investigated during wounddebridement for 11 patients (9–40 years), demonstrating that VR lowered pain ratings andincreased fun ratings for those who reported feeling engrossed in the VR game [16].Virtual reality technology has also been studied with burn patients undergoing physicaltherapy. Hoffman et al. examined the use of pharmacologic analgesia alone versus VR inaddition to analgesia during physical therapy [17]. Patients in the VR group reported lowerratings of pain and an increased range of motion. In another study, Hoffman et al. comparedthe use of VR to no distraction during physical therapy [18]. After the VR condition,patients reported decreased pain and a greater range of motion. Sharar et al. reported resultsacross three studies and concluded that VR in addition to standard analgesia reduced painintensity, unpleasantness and time spent thinking about pain [19]. Carrougher et al. foundsimilar results among burn patients undergoing physical therapy/rehabilitation, withnonsignificant clinical improvements in range of motion [20].Patterson and colleagues were the first to use VR technology to augment hypnosis (virtualreality hypnosis [VRH]) [21]. This was a novel and cutting-edge approach to the integrationof VR with a pre-existing evidence-based treatment for reducing pain and anxiety.Procedurally, VRH is administered by providing the patient with an audio recording ofhypnotic induction, suggestions for pain relief and then drifting the participant into thevirtual world [22]. Patterson et al. studied VR as a means of delivering hypnosis to patientswith burns during wound care in a clinical case series of 13 patients [21]. These patientsreported lower levels of pain and anxiety. For this study, Patterson used a VR distractionsequence, SnowWorld©, developed by Hoffman, which allows users to glide through a 3Dicy canyon while throwing snowballs at virtual snowmen, igloos, robots and penguins.Similarly, Konstantatos et al. examined the efficacy of VR relaxation in addition tomorphine for pain reduction during burn wound dressing changes. Instead of using adistraction type program, such as SnowWorld, the researchers developed a VR relaxationsequence prepared by psychologists and based on hypnotherapy theory [23]. This providedcalming visual scenery, which instructed the participant to concentrate on a moving spiral.Contrary to previous results, this study found an increase in pain intensity for participantsreceiving VR with morphine during wound care. Mixed findings may be related to the VE,the degree of immersion and varying methodologies. While VR distraction is effective forreducing pain during burn wound care, VR relaxation may not deliver the same result.In general, VR has been reported to be an effective modality to decrease pain during burncare. A recent systematic review of nine studies by Morris et al. found that VR coupled withstandard analgesia was effective in reducing pain during burn care in eight of the ninestudies [5]. Varying methodologies, patient characteristics and VR technology, maycontinue to contribute to mixed findings. Nonetheless, continued research in burn care is warranted with VR and VR enhanced interventions for managing the associated pain andanxiety.Cancer painVirtual reality technology has also been studied as a way to decrease pain, unpleasantnessand anxiety associated with common painful cancer procedures and treatments, such aschemotherapy, lumbar puncture and port access. A study by Schneider and Workmanexamined 11 children (aged 10–17 years) receiving chemotherapy with and without VR[24]. A total of 82% of the children stated that treatment with VR was better than previoustreatments and that they would like to use VR during future treatments. Sander Wint et al.investigated VR use during lumbar puncture with a sample of 30 adolescents (aged 10–19years) [25]. Although pain scores were lower in the VR condition, differences were notstatistically significant. A study by Gershon et al., studying children and adolescentsrequiring port access, compared VR distraction, non-VR distraction (computer) and standardof care [26]. Findings indicated that VR distraction was significantly better than standard ofcare in terms of reducing physiological arousal (i.e., pulse rate) and pain ratings. VR hasalso been demonstrated to decrease symptom distress and perceived time spent receivingchemotherapy, termed the time–elapse compression effect [6,27].Routine medical proceduresMany routine medical procedures, such as a blood draw, intravenous placement andimmunization can be painful and anxiety provoking. Gold et al. investigated the use of VRdistraction during outpatient blood draw in children [28]. The sample consisted of 100children (8–12 years old) stratified for age and gender into four conditions: no distraction,cartoon distraction, VR via computer or VR via HMD. The children in all conditions placedtheir arm through a pass wall for the blood draw in order to control for visual occlusion.Children in the VR HMD group reported a lower frequency of moderate-to-severe painintensity levels compared with the other three groups (χ2 [15, N = 100] = 25.54, p < 0.05).No significant differences were found in average pain intensity and state anxiety betweenthe four conditions. Gold et al. examined the use of VR with 20 children (8–12 years of age)requiring intravenous placement of contrast for an MRI CT scan [9]. Children wererandomly assigned to one of two conditions: standard of care (topical anesthetic) or VRpresented via HMD plus standard of care. While children in the control condition had afourfold increase in pain (p < 0.01), children in the VR condition reported no significantchanges in pain intensity between pre- and postintravenous placement. Furthermore,children, caregivers and nurses were more satisfied with the use of VR for pain managementduring the procedure.Furman et al. compared VR with watching movies as alternative forms of analgesia in 38patients during scaling and root planning, a painful dental procedure [7]. Pain scores weresignificantly lower in the VR group compared with the movie group and controls. Furman etal. modeled the study closely on a case study by Hoffman et al. [18], which examined twopatients who received scaling and root planning, and both reported lower pain ratings duringthe VR condition than during the movie and control conditions.VR for chronic pain managementWhile there is growing evidence supporting VR’s effectiveness in managing acuteprocedural pain, little is known about the use of VR for treating patients with chronic painand/or for long-term pain rehabilitation. To date, only a few studies have investigated VRfor chronic pain management and the data are preliminary. Sato et al. investigated the use of VR for treating complex regional pain syndrome in adults[29]. In this pilot study, a VR mirror visual feedback system was created and applied to thetreatment of complex regional pain syndrome in five adult patients (46–74 years old). Thiswas a nonimmersive form of VR, as participants were not engaged in VR through an HMD.However, the game was interactive as the VR mirror visual tracking device followed theparticipants’ hands as they completed target-oriented motor exercises such as reaching out,grasping, transferring and placing. In the study, patients participated in five to eightoutpatient sessions, resulting in four of the five patients demonstrating at least 50%reduction in their pain intensity scores. This study demonstrates how VR could be appliedfor the treatment of chronic pain. Further investigations with larger samples and refinedmethodologies must be conducted to replicate these results. In addition, future studiesshould look at the effectiveness of immersive VR programs for the treatment of complexregional pain syndrome and other chronic pain conditions.Sarig-Bahat et al. investigated VR’s ability to treat chronic neck pain in 67 patients (22–65years) with and without symptoms [30]. The investigators used a VR environment, whichencouraged patients to increase their range of motion by ‘spraying’ flies with a virtual spraycanister. In theory, the more they engaged in the activity, the greater their range of motionwould become. The investigators found that a single session of VR resulted in increasedcervical range of motion and decreased neck pain.Hoffman et al. explored whether immersive VR could help reduce pain during repeatedphysical therapy sessions for burn victims [18]. During three sessions, seven patients (9–32years of age) came to perform range-of-motion exercises under an occupational therapists’direction. Participants spent an equal amount of time during the session with VR distractionand without. The investigators found that pain ratings were significantly lower when patientswere immersed in VR and the magnitude of pain reduction did not decrease over multiplesessions. These findings are promising as they indicate a potential for VR to be applied tolong-term physical therapy.As described in acute pain management, VR has recently been studied to augment the effectof hypnosis for the treatment of chronic pain. In a case study of a 36-year old female with a5-year history of retractable chronic neuropathic pain, investigators found that following a 6-month trial of VRH, the patient’s pain ratings decreased 36% for 3.86 h and unpleasantnessdecreased 33% for 12.21 h on average across 33 sessions [22]. In addition, when the first tensessions of VRH were compared with the first ten sessions of previously completedhypnosis (non-VR) treatment, investigators found that VRH led to a reported average of 8.5h of pain reduction and 4.3 h of being pain free, compared with an average of 1 h of painreduction and 0 h of being pain free after hypnosis (non-VR). In conclusion, VRH wasfound to be more effective than hypnosis alone, by reducing pain and prolonging thetreatment effects. Although the usage of VR for chronic pain management is still in itsinfancy, pilot findings are promising.Experimental pain & VR in healthy populationsA critical line of research is the examination of experimental pain and VR in healthyparticipants. This paradigm has many advantages, as investigators are attempting to isolateand/or deconstruct critical parameters involved in the clinical efficacy of VR. These studiesallow investigators to look at the effects of VR while controlling confounding factors suchas clinical pathology, exposure to pain or adjunctive medications, hospital environment, andvarious other patient and disease characteristics. Therefore, this type of research enablesinvestigators to control and manipulate the effects of the unique characteristics thatcontribute to VR distraction or modulation Experimental pain has been delivered through a variety of mechanical and thermalmodalities, including a modified tourniquet [31], an ischemic tourniquet [32], a bloodpressure cuff [33], cold pressor [34–36] and a noxious warm or cold thermal painstimulation (Figure 3) [37]. In general, VR has been demonstrated to be effective inincreasing pain tolerance and pain threshold, and decreasing pain intensity, affective distressand pain unpleasantness [31–37].There is scientific concern that individuals may habituate to VR and, therefore, lose itsbenefits over repeated exposures. Rutter et al. conducted an 8-week trial of once-weekly VRdistraction during a cold pressor pain paradigm on 28 adults (18–23 years old) [35]. Resultsindicated that VR distraction led to significant increases in pain threshold and paintolerance, and significant decreases in pain intensity, time spent thinking about pain andself-reported anxiety. Unique findings specific to this study demonstrated that the effects ofVR remained stable across the eight sessions, indicating that repeated exposure did not alterVR’s effectiveness. These findings are similar to a clinical trial of VR versus traditionalphysical therapy for patients following burn injuries. Hoffman et al. demonstrated that VRreduced pain across multiple physical therapy sessions and treatment effects persistedwithout habituation for patients with burns [18]. Additional studies should investigatewhether treatment effects continue across treatment sessions for participants with other painconditions.Another line of VR investigation has specifically focused on the technology anddifferentiating the effects of HMD versus no HMD, and high versus low HMD technology.Dahlquist et al. found that the use of an HMD resulted in an increase in pain threshold andpain tolerance for children over the age of 10 years, but had no significant differences forchildren under 10 years of age [34,36]. Hoffman et al. compared a low- versus high-tech VRHMD for pain attenuation during an experimental thermal pain paradigm and found that thehigh-tech VR helmet group reported greater reductions in ‘worst’ pain (34%), ‘painunpleasantness’ (46%) and ‘time spent thinking about pain’ (29%), as well as greater funduring the pain stimulus (32%) than the low-tech VR group [38]. Only 29% of participantsin the low-tech helmet group, compared with 65% of participants in the high-tech VRhelmet group, showed a clinically significant reduction in pain intensity during VR.Together, these results reflect important developmental and technological considerationswhen evaluating the impact and efficacy of VR. The current results suggest that the use of aHMD with older children resulted in an increase in pain threshold and pain tolerance, whilethe use of a high-tech VR HMD was more effective at reducing pain than a low-tech VRHMD.Patterson et al. combined posthypnotic suggestion with VR distraction versus VR alone in103 undergraduate psychology student volunteers (18–40 years old) [21]. After receiving athermal pain stimulus with no distracter at baseline, each participant received hypnosis or nohypnosis, followed by virtual reality distraction (VRD) or no VRD during another painstimulus. Patterson et al. found that audio hypnosis combined with VRD reduced subjective‘worst pain’ and ‘pain unpleasantness’ by 22 and 25%, respectively, more than VRD alone[21]. Combination therapies, which include VR as a method for delivering hypnosis training,may be promising new therapies for managing pain.VR & neurobiologyFunctional imaging studies of the human brain’s response to painful stimuli have shownincreases of activities in the anterior cingulate gyrus, the insula, the thalamus, andsometimes in other regions such as the primary somatosensory cortex and the periaqueductalgray matter [39–47]. These brain regions may be considered to host a network of circuitry involved in the bottom-up, top-down and intercortical processing of painful stimuli, or evensomewhere, somehow the origin of the experience of pain itself. However, these regionsalso respond more or less to a range of aversive to nonaversive stimuli, and a wide range oftask-driven attention, distraction or affective conditions [40,42,45]. The responses of somesubsets of these regions have been related to sensation/pain intensity and painunpleasantness by imaging with well-controlled psychophysical measures [48–53].However, difficulties in separating brain regions that process sensory information fromthose that mediate affective responses is presently an area of active debate. To date,functional imaging or other methods of investigation have not produced an objective, directbrain correlate of the pain experience, nor is there a clear picture of how the brain’s sensoryand affective mechanisms act together on the dimension of pain in response to potentiallyaversive stimuli.Virtual reality has been found to attenuate pain, and this effect has been called ‘VRanalgesia’ [35,54–56]. The subjective ratings of pain reduction by VR has been corroboratedwith functional MRI (fMRI) data showing reduced brain activity increases in regionscommonly strongly activated by experimental thermal pain stimulation (Figure 4).Hoffman’s study, however, mainly focuses on whether VR game playing, as a whole,significantly reduces the increase of brain activities in the classic pain areas associated withnoxious thermal stimuli. Another published study compared VR with the effects of opioids(hydromorphone injection) on brain activities related to thermal pain stimulation, and foundthat opioids and VR significantly reduced pain-related brain activity in the insula andthalamus, but not other regions of the pain circuitry [54]. On the other hand, other cognitivetasks have been demonstrated to attenuate brain activity in the classic pain circuitry duringexperimental pain stimulation. Bantick et al. proposed a theory of pain attenuation viadistraction (exemplified by an adapted Stroop task) to decrease pain perception as measuredby fMRI and subjective pain ratings in eight right-handed volunteers (mean age 30 ± 9years) [57]. The adaptive counting Stroop task required the subject to count the number ofwords with incongruent meanings on the display screen. Subjective reports of pain intensitywere lower during the Stroop distraction condition. During the distraction task, there was anoverall decrease in BOLD signal in the insula, thalamus, hippocampus and midcingulateregion of the anterior cingulated cortex, which are known brain regions associated with painperception. Inversely, an increase in BOLD signal was observed in the perigenual region ofthe anterior cingulated cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, demonstrating the plausibility ofinter-cortical modulation or top-down inhibition of pain signaling. Valet et al. hypothesizedthat the cingulo–frontal cortex may exert top-down influences on the periaqueductal graymatter and posterior thalamus to modulate pain during distraction [58]. Performing thecounting Stroop task requires sustained attention plus other high-level cognitive functions.Whether the counting Stroop task’s analgesic effect is explained solely by attention ‘gating’or via other mechanisms cannot be determined by Bantick’s or Valet’s data. The increasedactivity in the cingulo–frontal cortex may be caused by the increased cognitive demand ofthe task, not simply by the mechanism of attention distraction alone [59]. In other words,attention does not necessitate task loading, but task loading does require attention.Additional studies are required to shed light on these issues to advance our understanding ofthe underlying cortical processes responsible for pain attenuation.While known distracting cognitive tasks have demonstrated top-down modulation of painsignaling via frontal cortical processes, VR remains somewhat enigmatic with regard to itsunderlying neurobiological mechanisms. To date, in addition to the distraction of attention,studies have associated cognitive analgesic effects to cognitive task loading [59], mood [60],expectancy [61] and perceived controllability [62]. A VR environment is capable ofmanipulating an even more complex set of cognitive and emotional conditions than thepresentation of most classic cognitive tasks. Therefore, VR’s analgesic effect may originate from the interplay of these classic mechanisms or from something beyond. For example, aVR environment is well known for eliciting a ‘transported’ presence, over and beyond anycognitive tasks the subject is performing at the same time. Elaborate experimental designscapable of isolating the contribution of transported presence are required to illuminate theneural mechanisms underlying VR analgesia.Current NIH studiesThe number of NIH-funded studies investigating the use of VR for pain management hasdoubled in the past year [101]. Cohen (Georgia State University, USA) is looking at theeffectiveness of coaching children in deep-breathing relaxation (biofeedback) through a VRsystem during fracture manipulation and repair [101]. Patterson (University of Washington,USA) is examining the efficacy of VR combined with hypnosis for patients who haveexperienced severe physical trauma and pediatric patients undergoing physical therapypostburn. In addition, Patterson will conduct an experimental study using analog electricpain to further explore the mechanisms underlying VR’s analgesic effects [101].Sharar (University of Washington) will study the neurophysiologic mechanisms underlyingVR as compared with other pharmacologic pain management methods. This study will beconducted in a healthy adult population with thermally and/or electrically induced pain. Painwill be rated through subjective measures and fMRI [101]. Similarly, Gold (University ofSouthern California, Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, USA) will employ fMRI to explorethe neurobiological mechanisms involved in VR pain attenuation in healthy adolescents(aged 14–17 years). An experimental fMRI-compatible thermal pain paradigm will be usedto evaluate the hypothesis that VR will reduce brain activity in brain regions associated withpain perception (e.g., thalamus, somatosensory and motor cortices, insular cortices,cingulated cortices and basal ganglia) [101]. In addition, the reduction of brain activityobserved in regions associated with pain perception during VR will concurrently beassociated with increased activity in distal regions of the brain (e.g., prefrontal cortex)commonly associated with attention, emotion, cognition and response inhibition. Sharar andGold’s studies will provide important insight into VR’s underlying mechanistic effects onneural activity in participants subjected to experimental pain [101].Wichman Askay (University of Washington) will investigate the use of VRH as treatmentfor chronic burn pain. Participants must have been burned in the past 2 years, stillexperience pain and no longer use medication. This pilot study may provide valuableknowledge for the use of VR in the treatment of chronic pain [101].ConclusionVirtual reality has consistently been demonstrated to decrease pain, anxiety, unpleasantness,time spent thinking about pain and perceived time spent in a medical procedure. In addition,healthcare providers have routinely commented that VR increases procedural cooperation,while decreasing anxiety and distress. Nurses have commented that it helps children be lessnervous and more calm, leading to less challenging and stressful medical procedures. VR incombination with standard of care often facilitates a smoother procedure (i.e., fewer needlepricks/attempts). To date, VR for acute painful medical procedures has shown the bestpromise as a primary or complementary pain management practice. However, other studieshave reported negative effects, mixed findings or limitations owing to age and/ortechnology.To date, few studies have researched VR as a complementary intervention for managingchronic pain or facilitating pain rehabilitation. Preliminary studies have demonstrated thatVR maintains its efficacy over repeated sessions, speeds up pain rehabilitation, increases the range of motion and extends the duration of treatment effects (i.e., longer perceptions ofreduced pain and unpleasantness). As the field advances, VR may decrease the number ofneeded treatment sessions, and may reduce or eliminate the need for narcotics during painfulprocedures. VR is showing initial promise for managing chronic pain and facilitating long-term pain rehabilitation; however, numerous scientific questions remain.Although chronic pain affects an estimated 70 million Americans, it is a tragicallyoverlooked public health problem [102]. The documented burden of chronic pain is greaterthan that of diabetes, heart disease and cancer combined. A 1998 NIH report concluded thatthe economic toll of chronic pain is alone estimated at US$100 billion a year in the USAwith predicted steady and significant increases in years to come [103]. Future investigationsof VR for chronic pain management are warranted given the scope, severity, and especiallygiven the personal and societal burden of the illness. Future studies should continue todeconstruct critical variables identified in VR analgesia and controlled trials should beconducted using rigorous methodologies with standardized outcomes to evaluate theefficacy of VR for chronic pain management.A new line of VR research has recently emerged augmenting evidence-based therapies, suchas biofeedback and hypnosis with VR technology. To this end, investigators are currentlyresearching VRH and VR biofeedback for children and adults with chronic pain. To date,investigators have found that VR and hypnosis used together are more effective than VR orhypnosis alone. Therefore, coupling VR with these therapies might prove to be valuable forthe management of chronic pain and long-term pain rehabilitation.Finally, investigations are currently underway to determine the neurobiological mechanismsunderlying VR’s ability to decrease pain perception. Current fMRI results indicate thatparticipants who are actively engaged in VR demonstrate inhibition of pain signaling in thecritical regions of the pain matrix; although this finding is not novel to VR alone. Similardecreases in cortical activation in the pain matrix during experimentally induced pain havebeen observed when using adapted Stroop cognitive tasks involving the distraction ofattention, task loading [59], mood [60], expectancy [61] and perceived controllability [62].Therefore, VR researchers are not solely interested in the deactivation of known critical painregions in the pain matrix, but rather the unique interplay of other peripheral cortical areasthat may be influenced by VR. It is hypothesized that frontal lobe/pain inhibitory pathways,critical nerve gating mechanisms and/or other neurochemical processes may be triggeredduring VR, thus leading to decreased pain, increased top-down inhibition and possibly VRanalgesia. Ultimately, understanding the myriad of neurobiological mechanisms underlyingVR analgesia will be critical for creating age and developmentally appropriate clinicalinterventions for acute painful procedures and a variety of chronic pain conditions.Future perspectiveScientists, clinicians and educators are just beginning to scratch the surface when it comes tocurrent applications of VR for pain management. Historically, VR technology has beenexpensive, available to few and mostly sought out by researchers and gaming technicians.The current state of VR as a tool for pain management is still in its early developmentalstages. With technology rapidly evolving, increased interest in complementarynonpharmacological interventions, and the reported burden and disability associated withincreasing rates of chronic pain, VR is quickly gaining attention as a complementary painmanagement strategy. What was once valued solely as high-tech entertainment equipmenthas now captured the interest of neuroscientists, clinical researchers and pain managementclinicians. Virtual reality will have a significant impact in the areas of acute and chronic painmanagement, as well as psychiatric and pain/physical rehabilitation over the next 5–10years. As the costs associated with VR technology decrease and the flexibility/customizability of the gaming environments increase, VR will have numerous applicationsfor patients with an array of acute and chronic medical conditions. Eventually, as part of ahealthcare providers toolkit, VR may be integrated into a variety of medical settings forroutine painful medical procedures, physical therapy, pain rehabilitation, chronic painmanagement and to treat a variety of psychiatric conditions (i.e., anxiety, post-traumaticstress disorder and substance abuse), to name a few. The ability to instantly transport thepatient into a virtual world for the purposes of distraction, exposure to a feared situation, orto augment diaphragmatic breathing, guided imagery and/or self-hypnosis makes VR atremendously powerful tool.Ultimately, an important advancement is the portability of VR for private practice andeventually home use. At that point, VR will no longer be used solely in a medical setting forpainful medical procedures, but will be expanded for the management of chronic pain,physical therapy, long-term rehabilitation and other associated symptoms. In addition, VRmay be used to augment and/or deliver other therapies such as hypnosis and biofeedback.The expanding scope of VR is on the rise and is promising for the field of pain managementand beyond. Given the advances in neuroscience, such as increased knowledge regarding theconnectivity of brain and behavior, pain perception and modulation, and the dynamicinterplay between biological and psychological (e.g., attention, memory and emotion)factors implicated in pain perception, VR will emerge as a viable first-line intervention andcomplementary therapy to pharmacologic agents. We are truly just beginning.BibliographyPapers of special note have been highlighted as:▪ of interest▪▪ of considerable interest1. Gershon J, Anderson P, Graap K, Zimand E, Hodges L, Rothbaum BO.

Therapeutic approaches have traditionally involved medication and physiotherapy but such approaches are limited over time by their cost and side effects. This review seeks to critically evaluate the evidence for and against IVR as an adjunctive therapy for acute clinical pain applications.\r\nMETHODS:\r\n\r\nA rapid evidence assessment (REA) strategy was used. CINAHL, Medline, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and the Cochrane Library databases were screened in from December 2012 to March 2013 to identify studies exploring IVR therapies as an intervention to assist in the management of pain. Main outcome measures were for acute pain and functional impairment.\r\nRESULTS:\r\n\r\nSeventeen research studies were included in total including 5 RCTs, 6 randomized crossover studies, 2 case series studies, and 4 single-patient case studies. This included a total of 337 patients. Of these studies only 4 had a low risk of bias. There was strong overall evidence for immediate and short-term pain reduction, whereas moderate evidence was found for short-term effects on physical function. Little evidence exists for longer-term benefits. IVR was not associated with any serious adverse events.\r\nDISCUSSION:\r\n\r\nThis review found moderate evidence for the reduction of pain and functional impairment after IVR in patients with acute pain. Further high-quality studies are required for the conclusive judgment of its effectiveness in acute pain, to establish potential benefits for chronic pain, and for safety.'),
